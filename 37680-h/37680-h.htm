<h2>THE PHILOSOPHY OF BREAKFAST</h2>


<p>The breakfast habit is of antique origin.
Presumably the primeval man arose from
troubled dreams, in the first gray light of
dawn, and set forth upon devious forest trails,
seeking that which he might devour, while the
primeval woman still slumbered in her cave.
Nowadays, it is the lady herself who rises
while the day is yet young, slips into a kimono,
and patters out into the kitchen to light the
gas flame under the breakfast food.</p>

<p>In this matter of breaking the fast, each
house is law unto itself. There are some who
demand a dinner at seven or eight in the morning,
and others who consider breakfast utterly
useless. The Englishman, who is still mighty
on the face of the earth, eats a breakfast which
would seriously tax the digestive apparatus
of an ostrich or a goat, and goes on his way
rejoicing.</p>

<p>In an English cook-book only seven years
old, menus for &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; breakfasts are given,
which run as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Devilled Drum-sticks and Eggs on the dish,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
Pigs Feet, Buttered Toast, Dry Toast, Brown
and White Bread and Butter, Marmalade and
Porridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bloaters on Toast, Collared Tongue, Hot
Buttered Toast, Dry Toast, Marmalade, Brown
and White Bread and Butter, Bread and Milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pigeon Pie, Stewed Kidney, Milk Rolls,
Dry Toast, Brown and White Bread and Butter,
Mustard and Cress, Milk Porridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And for a &ldquo;simple breakfast,&rdquo;&mdash;in August,
mind you!&mdash;this is especially recommended:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bloaters on Toast, Corned Beef, Muffins,
Brown and White Bread and Butter, Marmalade,
and Boiled Hominy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An American who ate a breakfast like that in
August probably would not send his collars to the
laundry more than once or twice more, but it
takes all kinds of people to make up a world.</p>

<p>Across the Channel from the brawny Briton
is the Frenchman, who, with infinitely more
wisdom, begins his day with a cup of coffee
and a roll. So far, so good, but his <i>d&eacute;jeuner &agrave;
la fourchette</i> at eleven or twelve is not always
unobjectionable from a hygienic standpoint.
The &ldquo;uniform breakfast,&rdquo; which is cheerfully
advocated by some, may be hygienic but it is
not exciting. Before the weary mental vision
stretches an endless procession of breakfasts,
all exactly alike, year in and year out. It is
quite possible that the &ldquo;no-breakfast&rdquo; theory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
was first formulated by some one who had
been, was, or was about to be a victim of this
system.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;no-breakfast&rdquo; plan has much to recommend
it, however. In the first place, it
saves a deal of trouble. The family rises,
bathes itself, puts on its spotless raiment in
leisurely and untroubled fashion, and proceeds
to the particular business of the day. There
are no burnt toast, soggy waffles, muddy coffee,
heavy muffins, or pasty breakfast food to be
reckoned with. Theoretically, the energy supplied
by last night&rsquo;s dinner is &ldquo;on tap,&rdquo; waiting
to be called upon. And, moreover, one is
seldom hungry in the morning, and what is the
use of feeding a person who is not hungry?</p>

<p>It has been often said, and justly, that Americans
eat too much. Considering the English
breakfast, however, we may metaphorically pat
ourselves upon the back, for there is no one
of us, surely, who taxes the Department of the
Interior thus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is one man&rsquo;s meat is another man&rsquo;s
poison&rdquo; has been held pointedly to refer to
breakfast, for here, as nowhere else, is the individual
a law unto himself. Fruit is the satisfaction
of one and the distress of another;
cereal is a life-giving food to one and a soggy
mass of indigestibility to some one else; and
coffee, which is really most innocent when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
properly made, has lately taken much blame
for sins not its own.</p>

<p>Quite often the discomfort caused by the ill-advised
combination of acid fruit with a starchy
cereal has been attributed to the clear, amber
beverage which probably was the much-vaunted
&ldquo;nectar of the gods.&rdquo; Coffee with cream in it
may be wrong for some people who could use
boiling milk with impunity.</p>

<p>For a woman who spends the early part of
the day at home, the omission of breakfast may
be salutary. When hunger seizes her, she is
within reach of her own kitchen, where proper
foods may be properly cooked, but for a business
woman or man the plan is little less than
suicidal. Mr. Man may, indeed, go down town
in comfort, with no thought of food, but, no
later than noon, he is keenly desirous of interior
decoration. Within his reach there is,
usually, but the lunch counter, where, in company
with other hapless humans, he sustains
himself with leathery pie, coffee which never
met the coffee bean, and the durable doughnut
of commerce. The result is&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;discontent,
which seemingly has no adequate
cause.</p>

<p>It is better, by far, for Mr. Man to eat a
breakfast which shall contain the proteids,
carbohydrates, phosphates, and starches that he
will require during the day, and omit the noon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
luncheon entirely, except, perhaps, for a bit of
fruit. Moreover, a dainty breakfast, daintily
served, has a distinct &aelig;sthetic value. The
temper of the individual escorted to the front
door by a devoted spouse has more than a little
to do with the temper of the selfsame individual
who is let in at night by the aforesaid
D.&nbsp;S.</p>

<p>Many a man is confronted in the morning by
an untidy, ill-cooked breakfast, a frowsy woman
and a still frowsier baby, and, too often, by
querulous whinings and complaints.</p>

<p>The ancient Britons had a pleasing arrangement
which they called &ldquo;The Truce of God.&rdquo;
By this, there was no fighting whatever, no
matter what the provocation, between sunset on
Wednesday and sunrise on Monday. This gave
time for other affairs, and for the exercise of
patience, toleration, and other virtues of the
same ilk.</p>

<p>Many a household might take a leaf from this
book to good advantage. Settle all differences
after dinner, since at no time of the day is man
in more reasonable mood, and ordain a &ldquo;Truce
of God&rdquo; from dawn until after dinner.</p>

<p>No dinner, however beautifully cooked and
served, no fine raiment, however costly and becoming,
can ever atone, in the memory of a
man, for the wild and untamed morning which
too often prevails in the American household.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
His mind, distraught with business cares, harks
back to his home&mdash;with pleasure? None too
often, more&rsquo;s the pity.</p>

<p>Some one has said that, in order to make a
gentleman, one must begin with the grandfather.
It is equally true that a good and
proper breakfast begins the night before&mdash;or,
better yet, the morning before.</p>

<p>Careful, systematic planning in advance lightens
immeasurably the burden of housekeeping,
and, many a time, makes the actual work
nothing but fun. Those who have tried the
experiment of planning meals for the entire
week are enthusiastic in praise of the system.
It secures variety, simplifies marketing, arranges
for left-overs, and gives many an hour
of peace and comfort which could not be had
otherwise.</p>

<p>Even if a woman be her own maid, as, according
to statistics, eighty-five per cent. of us are, a
dainty, hygienic, satisfying breakfast is hers and
her lord&rsquo;s for little more than the asking. By
careful preparation in advance, the morning
labor is reduced to a minimum; by the intelligent
use of lists and memoranda, the weary
and reluctant body is saved many an unnecessary
step.</p>

<p>An alarm clock of the &ldquo;intermittent&rdquo; sort
insures early rising, a dash of cold water on the
face is a physical and mental tonic of the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
agreeable kind, and one hour in the morning is
worth two at night, as the grandmothers of all
of us have often said.</p>

<p>Fruit, usually, may be prepared for serving the
night before, and will be improved by a few hours
in the refrigerator. Cereals should be soaked
over night in the water in which they are to be
cooked, and a few hours&rsquo; cooking in the afternoon
will injure very few cereals destined for the
breakfast table the next morning. Codfish
balls and many other things will be none the
worse for a night&rsquo;s waiting; the table can be
set, and everything made ready for a perfect
breakfast, which half an hour of intelligent effort
in the morning will readily evolve.</p>

<p>A plea is made for the use of the chafing-dish,
which is fully as attractive at the breakfast
table as in the &ldquo;wee sma&rsquo; hours&rdquo; in which it
usually shines; for a white apron instead of a
gingham one when &ldquo;my lady&rdquo; is also the cook;
for a crisp, clean shirt-waist instead of an abominable
dressing-sack; for smooth, tidy hair, instead
of unkempt locks; for a collar and a belt,
and a persistent, if determined, cheerfulness.</p>

<p>In the long run, these things pay, and with
compound interest at that. They involve a certain
amount of labor, a great deal of careful planning,
eternal getting-up when it is far more
pleasant to abide in dreamland, quite often a
despairing weariness, if not a headache, and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
small draft upon one&rsquo;s power of self-denial and
self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>But he who goes in the morning from a quiet,
comfortable, well-ordered house, with a pleasant
memory of the presiding genius of his
hearthstone, is twice the man that his fellow
may be, whose wife breakfasts at ten in her bed,
or, frowsy and unkempt, whines at him from

for the ceaseless grind of an exhausting day

night, footsore, weary, and depressed, to the
four walls wherein he abides.</p>

<p>To some, this may seem an undue stress laid

essence of a happy home.</p>

<h2>HOW TO SET THE TABLE</h2>


<p>Having said so much, we proceed, not to our
mutton, as the French have it, but to our breakfast,
in which the table plays no small nor unimportant
part.</p>

<p>There are rumors that the pretty and sensible
fashion of doilies on the bare table is on the
wane, but let us hope these are untrue, or, if not,
that some of us may have the courage of our convictions
and continue to adhere to a custom
which has everything in its favor and nothing
against it.</p>

<p>In the absence of handsome top of oak or mahogany,
the breakfast cloths, fringed or not, as
one likes, which are about a yard and a quarter
square, are the next best thing. Asbestos mats,
under the cloth, protect the table from the hot
dishes. Failing these, fairly satisfactory substitutes
are made from thin white oil-cloth, between
two layers of canton flannel, &ldquo;fur side
outside,&rdquo; and quilted on the machine. Grass
table-mats are also used, but always under cloth
or doily. Canton flannel, quilted, three layers
to a mat, is easily washed, and furnishes a great
deal of protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
Breakfast, most assuredly, is not dinner, and
there should be a distinct difference in the laying
of the table. The small doilies are easily
washed, and fresh ones are possible every morning&mdash;an
assured gain in the way of daintiness.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that we have a handsome table-top,
and an unlimited supply of doilies, tray-cloths
and centrepieces. First the centrepiece
goes on, exactly in the centre, by the way, and
not with a prejudiced leaning to one side or the
other. On this belongs the pot of growing fern,
the low jar containing a few simple flowers, or a
bowl of fruit, decorated with green leaves, if
green leaves are to be had.</p>

<p>At each place the breakfast doily, nine or
twelve inches square, a small doily for the coffee
cup, and another for the glass of water. At the
right of the plate, the small silver knife, sharp
edge toward the plate, the spoons for fruit and
cereal; at the left, one fork, or two, as needed,
and the coffee spoon.</p>

<p>In front of the master of the house the small
platter containing the <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> will
eventually be placed; in front of the mistress
of the mansion, the silver tray bearing the
coffee service&mdash;coffee-pot, hot-water pitcher,
cream jug, milk pitcher, and sugar bowl.</p>

<p>Breakfast napkins are smaller than dinner
napkins, and the small fringed napkins are not
out of place. &ldquo;Costly thy habit as thy purse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
will buy&rdquo; might well refer to linen, for it is the
one thing in which price is a direct guarantee of
quality.</p>

<p>Satisfactory breakfast cloths and napkins are
made of linen sheeting, fringed, hemstitched,
or carefully hemmed by hand, and in this way
a pretty cloth can be had for less money than in
any other. The linen wears well, washes beautifully,
and acquires a finer sheen with every
tubbing. Insertions and borders of torchon or
other heavy lace make a breakfast cloth suitable
for the most elaborate occasion, and
separate doilies may easily be made to match.
The heavy white embroidery which has recently
come into favor is unusually attractive
here.</p>

<p>Finger-bowls wait on the sideboard, to be
placed after the fruit course, or after breakfast.
The rose-water, slice of lemon, geranium leaves,
and other finger-bowl refinements in favor for
dinners are out of place at breakfast. Clear,
cool water is in better taste.</p>

<p>The china used at the breakfast table should
be different from that used at dinner. Heavier
ware is permissible, and more latitude in the
way of decoration is given. Much of the breakfast
china one sees in the shops is distinctly
cheerful in tone, and one must take care to select
the more quiet patterns. It is not pleasant to
go to breakfast with a fickle appetite, and be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
greeted by a trumpet-toned &ldquo;Good Morning&rdquo;
from the china.</p>

<p>Endless difference is allowed, however, and
all the quaint, pretty jugs, pitchers, and plates
may properly be used at breakfast. One is wise,
however, to have a particular color scheme in
mind and to buy all china to blend with it. Blue
and white is a good combination, and is, perhaps,
more suitable for the morning meal than anything
else. As a certain philosopher says: &ldquo;The
blue and white look so pretty with the eggs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The carafe, muffin plate, platter, and all other
bowls, platters, plates, and pitchers not on the
individual cover have each a separate doily, with
the protecting mat always under hot dishes. A
well-set table is governed by a simple law&mdash;that
of precision. Dishes arranged in an order little
less than military, all angles either right or
acute, will, for some occult reason, always look
well. Informality may be given by the arrangement
of the flowers, or by a flower or two laid
carelessly on the table. But one must be careful
not to trifle too much with this law of precision.
Knives, forks, and spoons must all be
laid straight, but not near enough together to
touch, and napkins and dishes must be precisely
placed, else confusion and riot will result.</p>

<p>The breakfast selected as a type consists of
fruit, a cereal, salt fish, or salt meat, or eggs, or
omelets, hot bread of some kind, and pancakes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
or waffles, or coffee cake, one dish from each
group, and coffee. Six dishes in all, which may
be less if desired, but never more. All six form
a breakfast sufficiently hearty for a stone mason
or a piano mover; one or two give a breakfast
light enough to tempt those who eat no breakfast
at all. For serving it are required small and
medium-sized plates, knives, forks, spoons, egg
cups, platters, service plates, cups and saucers,
glasses, coffee-pot, pitchers, sugar bowl, and
cream jug, syrup pitcher, and fruit bowl.</p>

<p>Fruit is said to be &ldquo;gold in the morning,&rdquo; and
it is a poor breakfast, indeed, from which it is
omitted. Even in winter it is not hard to secure
variety, if time and thought be taken, for
the dried fruits are always in the market and by
careful cooking may be made acceptable to the
most uncertain appetite.</p>

<p>Medical authorities recommend a glass of
water taken the first thing upon rising, either
hot or cold as suits one best. A little lemon-juice
takes the &ldquo;flat&rdquo; taste from plain hot
water, and clear, cool water, not iced, needs nothing
at all. This simple observance of a very
obvious hygienic rule will temper the tempestuous
morning for any one. One washes his face,
his hands, his body&mdash;then why not his stomach,
which has worked hard a large part of the night,
and is earnestly desirous of the soothing refreshment
of a bath?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
To those carping critics who cavil at the appearance
of the stomach in a chapter entitled
&ldquo;How to Set the Table,&rdquo; we need only say
that the table is set for the stomach, and the
stomach should be set for the table, and anyway,
it comes very near being a table of contents,
<i>n&rsquo;est-ce pas</i>?</p>

<h3>FOOT-NOTES</h3>

<p>1. The author began with the intention of
adapting the entire Rubaiyat to kitchen purposes,
but thought better of it just in time to
head off the Lyric Muse, who was coming at
full gallop, with her trunk.</p>

<p>2. Those who do not like The Kitchen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
Rubaiyat will doubtless be glad there is no more
of it.</p>

<p>3. Those who do like it can begin at the beginning
and read it again. The rest of it would
be about like this installment, anyway.</p>

<p>P. S. If the demand is great enough, the
rest of it may appear in another book.</p>

<p>P. S. 2. The publisher of this book has an
unalterable prejudice against printing poetry,
but he allowed The Kitchen Rubaiyat to slip
by without question.</p>

<p>The above table, of course, is only a rough
outline, as seasons and localities vary so much.
The tendency, too, is to extend the season of
every fruit indefinitely, as transporting and
refrigerating methods improve. Fruit out of
season is always expensive, and often unripe
and unsatisfactory. Fortunately, when it is at
its best it is always abundant and at the lowest
price.</p>

<p>Among the dried fruits may be mentioned
Prunelles, Apricots, Apples, Blackberries, Cherries,
Nectarines, Peaches, peeled and unpeeled,
Pears, Plums, Raspberries, Prunes, Figs, and
Dates. Canned fruits which may be used
for breakfast, with proper preparation, are
Pears, Peaches, Apricots, Cherries, Plums, and
Pineapples.</p>

<p>Dried fruits may be soaked over night in the
water in which they are to be cooked, and simmered
slowly, until they are tender, with little
sugar or none at all. They may also be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
steamed, either with or without sugar, omitting
the soaking, until tender enough for a
straw to pierce. Combinations of dried fruits
are often agreeable, and a few raisins will
sometimes add a pleasant flavor.</p>

<p>Canned fruits intended for breakfast should
be drained and very thoroughly rinsed in cold
water, then allowed to stand for some hours in
a cool place.</p>

<p>Many of the fruits, both dried and fresh,
combine well with cereals. Care must be taken,
however, to follow such acid fruits as Currants,
Cherries, Oranges, and Grapefruit, with meat
or egg dishes, omitting the cereal, as the starch
and acid are very likely to fight with each
other when once inside, to the inconvenience
of the non-combatant. A fruit which for any
reason tastes &ldquo;flat&rdquo; can be instantly improved
in flavor and tonic quality by a sprinkle of
lemon-juice.</p>

<p>Below are given different ways of preparing
fruit for the breakfast table.</p>


<h3>APPLES</h3>

<p>I. When served whole, apples should be
carefully washed and rubbed to a high polish
with a crash towel. Only perfect fruit should
be served in this way, and green leaves in the
fruit bowl are especially desirable. Fruit-knives
are essential.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
II. Pare, quarter, and core good eating apples,
removing all imperfections. Serve a few quarters
on each plate, with or without sugar. A
sprinkle of cinnamon or lemon-juice will improve
fruit which has little flavor. A grating
of nutmeg may also be used.</p>

<p>III. <i>&Agrave; la Cond&eacute;.</i>&mdash;Pare, quarter, and core good
cooking apples. Arrange in rows in an earthen
baking-dish, sprinkle with powdered sugar and
lemon-juice, pour a little water into the baking-dish,
and add a heaping tablespoonful of butter.
Bake slowly, basting frequently with the apple-juice
and melted butter. When tender, take
out, drain, and cool, saving the juice. Serve
with boiled rice or other cereal, using the juice
instead of milk.</p>

<p>IV. <i>&Agrave; la Cherbourg.</i>&mdash;Pare and core good
cooking apples; halve or quarter if desired.
Cook slowly in a thin syrup flavored with
lemon-peel and a bit of ginger-root. Serve separately
or with cereal.</p>

<p>V. <i>&Agrave; la Fermi&egrave;re.</i>&mdash;Pare and core the apples
and arrange in a well-buttered baking-dish.
Sprinkle slightly with sugar and cinnamon;
baste often with melted butter, and serve with
boiled rice or other cereal, using the juice instead
of milk.</p>

<p>VI. <i>&Agrave; la Fran&ccedil;aise.</i>&mdash;Core and then peel tart
apples. Put into cold water from half an inch
to an inch in depth, sprinkle with sugar, cover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
tightly, and cook very slowly on the back part
of the range till tender. Flavorings already
noted may be added at pleasure. Skim out the
apples, reduce the remaining syrup one-half by
rapid boiling, pour over the apples, and cool.
Serve cold, with or without cereal.</p>

<p>VII. <i>&Agrave; la Ninon.</i>&mdash;Sprinkle baked apples
with freshly grated cocoanut on taking from
the oven. Serve on a mound of boiled rice
with the milk of the cocoanut.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>&Agrave; la R&eacute;ligieuse.</i>&mdash;Core cooking apples;
score the skin deeply in a circle all around the
fruit. Sprinkle a little sugar in the cores, and
dissolve a little currant jelly in the water used
for the basting. Cook slowly, and baste once
with melted butter. The peel is supposed to
rise all around the apple, like a veil&mdash;hence the
name.</p>

<p>IX. <i>Baked.</i>&mdash;Peel or not, as preferred.
Sprinkle with melted butter and sugar, baste
now and then with hot water, and serve separately
or with cereal.</p>

<p>X. <i>Baked, with Bananas.</i>&mdash;Core, draw a
peeled and scraped banana through each core,
trimming the ends off even, and bake slowly,
basting with hot water, melted butter, and
lemon-juice. The apples may be peeled if desired.
Serve separately, or with cereal.</p>

<p>XI. <i>Baked, with Cereal.</i>&mdash;Pare or not, as preferred,
but core. Fill the centres with left-over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
cooked cereal and bake slowly. Butter,
lemon-juice, or any flavoring recommended
before can be used to advantage. Any quartered
apples, baked or stewed, can be covered
with any preferred cereal, and served with
sugar and cream.</p>

<p>XII. <i>Baked, with Cherries.</i>&mdash;Core the apples,
fill the centres with pitted cherries, either sour
or sweet, bake carefully, basting with syrup
and melted butter. The apples may be peeled
or not. Take up carefully, and serve separately,
or with cereal.</p>

<p>XIII. <i>Baked, with Currants.</i>&mdash;Fill the centres
with currants, red or white, and use
plenty of sugar. Baste with hot water or
melted butter. May be served with cereal if
enough sugar is used in baking.</p>

<p>XIV. <i>Baked, with Dates.</i>&mdash;Wash and stone
dates, fill the cores of apples with them,
sprinkle with powdered sugar and bake, basting
with butter, lemon-juice, and hot water.
The apples may be peeled or not.</p>

<p>XV. <i>Baked, with Figs.</i>&mdash;Wash the figs carefully,
and pack into the cores of apples. Bake,
basting with lemon syrup and melted butter.
Serve separately or with cereal.</p>

<p>XVI. <i>Baked, with Gooseberries.</i>&mdash;Cap and
stem a handful of gooseberries. Fill the cores
of large, firm apples with them, using plenty
of sugar. Baste with melted butter and hot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
water. May be served with cereal if plenty of
sugar is used in cooking.</p>

<p>XVII. <i>Baked, with Prunes.</i>&mdash;Select tart apples,
and peel or not, as preferred. Core and
fill the centres with stewed prunes, stoned and
drained. Bake slowly, basting with the prune-juice,
or with lemon-juice, melted butter,
spiced syrup, or hot water containing grated
lemon-peel and a teaspoonful of sherry. Two
or three cloves may be stuck into each apple,
and removed after the apples are cold. Serve,
very cold, with cream; separately, or with a
cereal.</p>

<p>XVIII. <i>Baked, with Quinces.</i>&mdash;Fill the cores
of sweet apples with bits of quince and plenty
of sugar. Bake slowly, basting with melted
butter and syrup. Serve separately or with
cereal.</p>

<p>XIX. <i>Baked, with Spice.</i>&mdash;Select very sour
apples, and peel or not, as preferred. Core,
and stuff the cavities with brown sugar, putting
two whole cloves into each apple. Baste
with hot water containing a bit of grated lemon-peel
and a teaspoonful of sherry, putting a
teaspoonful of butter into the liquor as it
forms in the dish. Bake slowly, covered,
until the apples are very tender. Serve separately
or with a cereal. Cinnamon, or nutmeg,
or a blade of mace may be used instead of the
cloves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
XX. <i>Boiled.</i>&mdash;Boil slowly in a saucepan with
as little water as possible. Do not peel. When
tender, lift out, add sugar to the water in which
they were boiled; reduce half by rapid boiling,
pour over the apples, and let cool. Currant-juice,
lemon-juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, or a
suspicion of clove may be added to the syrup if
the apples lack flavor.</p>

<p>XXI. <i>Coddled.</i>&mdash;Core, cut in halves, but do
not peel. Lay in the bottom of an earthen
dish, sprinkle lightly with sugar, add a little
water, and cook very slowly on the top of the
stove until tender.</p>

<p>XXII. <i>Crusts.</i>&mdash;Cut stale bread in circles,
lay half of a peeled and cored apple on each
piece. Bake carefully, basting with melted butter
and a little lemon-juice if desired. When
the apples are done, sprinkle with powdered
sugar, and take from the oven. Serve either
hot or cold.</p>

<p>XXIII. <i>Dried.</i>&mdash;Soak over night in water to
cover, after washing thoroughly; cook slowly
until soft, sweeten, and flavor with lemon.
Raisins, dates, figs, or other dried fruits may be
added at pleasure.</p>

<p>XXIV. <i>Fried.</i>&mdash;Core, but do not pare. If
very juicy, dredge with flour and fry slowly in
hot fat till tender. They are served with pork,
or, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon,
with cereals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
XXV. <i>Glazed.</i>&mdash;Core tart apples. Fill the
centres with cinnamon, sugar, bits of butter,
and a raisin or two. Bake slowly, basting with
lemon-syrup. When nearly done, brush with
the beaten white of egg and sprinkle with powdered
sugar. Serve separately or with cereal.</p>

<p>XXVI. <i>In Bloom.</i>&mdash;Cook pared red apples in
any preferred way, and stew the skin separately,
in a little water, until the color is extracted.
The tiniest bit of red vegetable coloring may be
needed. Strain this liquid, and pour it over the
apples when done. Or, add currant jelly to
color the water in which the apples are boiled,
or to the water for basting pared baked apples.</p>

<p>XXVII. <i>In Casserole.</i>&mdash;Arrange good cooking
apples in an earthen casserole. Cover with
a thin syrup made of brown sugar, add a little
spice and a bit of orange- or lemon-peel. Bake,
very slowly, tightly covered. Serve cold from
the casserole.</p>

<p><a name="applesxxviii" id="applesxxviii"></a>XXVIII. <i>In Crumbs.</i>&mdash;Cut strips of stale
bread to fit stone custard-cups. Dip in milk,
and arrange in the moulds. Fill the centres
with apple sauce, cover with a circle of the
bread, and steam thirty minutes. Serve cold,
with cream.</p>

<p><a name="applesxxix" id="applesxxix"></a>XXIX. <i>In Rice-Cups.</i>&mdash;Line buttered custard
cups with cold boiled rice. Fill the centres with
apple sauce or cooked quartered apples, mildly
tart rather than sweet. Cover with more of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
rice. Steam half an hour and let cool in the
cups. Turn out on chilled plates and serve with
cream. Cream may be used with any cooked
apple, if the Secretary of the Interior files no
objections. Cereals, other than rice, left over,
can be used in the same way. A wreath of
cooked apple quarters around the base of each
individual mould is a dainty and acceptable
garnish.</p>

<p>XXX. <i>Jellied.</i>&mdash;Cut tart apples in halves,
core, place in buttered baking-dish, skin side
down, measure the water and add enough
barely to cover; add twice as much sugar as
water, cover and boil slowly till the apples are
tender. Skim out, drain, boil the syrup rapidly
till reduced one half; pour over the apples and
let cool. Flavorings referred to before can be
added to the syrup if desired.</p>

<p>XXXI. <i>Mock Pineapple.</i>&mdash;Arrange alternate
slices of sweet apples and oranges, peeled, on a
chilled plate, one above the other. Sprinkle
with powdered sugar, pour over the orange-juice
and serve immediately.</p>

<p>XXXII. <i>Sauce.</i>&mdash;Peel, quarter, and core
quick-cooking apples. Sweeten slightly, and
when very tender, rub through a sieve and let
cool. Any flavoring recommended before may
be used.</p>

<p>XXXIII. <i>Snow.</i>&mdash;Peel white-fleshed, firm
apples, grate quickly on a coarse grater, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
serve in roughly piled heaps on small plates
immediately. Use sugar or not.</p>

<p>XXXIV. <i>Southern, Fried.</i>&mdash;Core and cut in
thick slices, but do not peel. Dip in egg and
crumbs and fry in ham or bacon fat and serve
with those meats.</p>

<p>XXXV. <i>Stewed.</i>&mdash;Pare, core, and halve large
cooking-apples. Put into an earthen dish, cover
with water, sprinkle with sugar, cover tightly,
and cook slowly. If flat in taste, sprinkle
with lemon-juice, cinnamon, or nutmeg.</p>

<p>XXXVI. <i>Stewed with Dates.</i>&mdash;Add washed
and stoned dates to stewed apples when partially
cooked, and finish cooking. Dried apricots,
fresh or dried cherries, rhubarb, figs,
plums, dried peaches, pears, or quinces, may be
used in the same way.</p>

<p>XXXVII. <i>Stewed with Rice.</i>&mdash;Boil rice as
usual in boiling water, adding a little salt.
When partly done, add pared, cored, and quartered
quick-cooking apples. Finish cooking.
Serve very cold with cream and sugar. Flavorings
noted above may be added at discretion.</p>


<h3>APRICOTS</h3>

<p>I. Wipe with a dry cloth and serve with fruit-knives.
A green leaf on each plate is a dainty
fruit doily.</p>

<p>II. <i>Canned.</i>&mdash;Drain, rinse in cold water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
arrange on plates, and let stand several hours
before serving. Sugar or not, as desired. Save
the syrup to flavor syrup for pancakes, or to
use for puddings, fritters, etc.</p>

<p>III. <i>Dried.</i>&mdash;Soak over night, cook very
slowly in the water in which they were soaked,
adding very little sugar. Serve with cereal, or
separately.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Sauce.</i>&mdash;Cook as above, and rub the fruit
through a sieve. The canned, drained, and
freshened fruit may be used in the same way.</p>


<h3>BANANAS</h3>

<p>I. Serve in the skins with fruit-knives, one
to each person.</p>

<p>II. Skin and scrape and serve immediately.
People who cannot ordinarily eat bananas
usually find them harmless when the tough,
stringy pulp is scraped off.</p>

<p>III. <i>Baked.</i>&mdash;Bake without peeling, basting
with hot water and melted butter occasionally.
Let cool in the skins.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Baked.</i>&mdash;Skin, scrape, and bake, basting
with lemon-juice and melted butter. Sprinkle
with sugar if desired.</p>

<p>V. <i>Au naturel.</i>&mdash;Slice into saucers, sprinkle
with lemon-juice and sugar.</p>

<p>VI. <i>With Sugar and Cream.</i>&mdash;Slice, sprinkle
with powdered sugar, pour cream over, and
serve at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
VII. <i>With Oranges.</i>&mdash;Slice, add an equal
quantity of sliced oranges, and sprinkle with
sugar.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>With Cereal.</i>&mdash;Slice fresh bananas into
a saucer, sprinkle with sugar, cover with boiled
rice or with any preferred cereal.</p>

<p>IX. Equally good with sliced peaches.</p>


<h3>BLACKBERRIES</h3>

<p>Serve with powdered sugar, with or without
cream. A tablespoonful of cracked ice in a
saucer of berries is appreciated on a hot
morning.</p>


<h3>BLUE PLUMS</h3>

<p>See <a href="#greengages"><b>Green Gages</b></a>.</p>


<h3>CHERRIES</h3>

<p>I. Serve very cold, with the stems on. A
dainty way is to lay the cherries upon a bed of
cracked ice, and serve with powdered sugar in
individual dishes.</p>

<p>II. Pit the cherries, saving the juice, and
serve in saucers with sugar and plenty of
cracked ice.</p>

<p><a name="cherriesiii" id="cherriesiii"></a>III. <i>Iced.</i>&mdash;Beat the white of an egg to a
foam. Dip each cherry into it, then roll in
powdered sugar, and set on a platter in the refrigerator.
Must be prepared overnight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
<a name="cherriesiv" id="cherriesiv"></a>IV. <i>Crusts.</i>&mdash;Butter rounds of stale bread,
spread with pitted cherries and their juice,
sprinkle with sugar, and bake. Serve very
cold.</p>


<h3>CURRANTS</h3>

<p>Serve in cracked ice with plenty of sugar.
These are also served iced, and on crusts. See
<a href="#cherriesiii"><b>Cherries III</b></a> and <a href="#cherriesiv"><b>IV</b></a>.</p>


<h3>FIGS</h3>

<p>May be served from the basket. This, of
course, applies only to the more expensive
varieties, which are clean. The ordinary dried
fig of commerce must be washed many times,
and is usually sweet enough without adding
more sugar.</p>

<p>II. <i>Steamed.</i>&mdash;Set a plate of figs in a steamer
over boiling water until plump and soft, then
set away to cool.</p>

<p>III. <i>Stewed.</i>&mdash;Clean, soak, and cook slowly
till tender in a little water. Skim out, drain,
sweeten the syrup slightly, reduce one half,
pour over the figs, and cool. A bit of vanilla or
wine may be added to the syrup.</p>

<p>IV. <i>With Cereal.</i>&mdash;Cover a saucer of steamed
or stewed figs with any preferred cereal. Serve
with cream if desired.</p>

<p>V. <i>In Rice-Cups.</i>&mdash;See <a href="#applesxxix"><b>Apples XXIX</b></a>.</p>

<p>VI. <i>In Crumbs.</i>&mdash;See <a href="#applesxxviii"><b>Apples XXVIII</b></a>.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span></p>

<h3>GOOSEBERRIES</h3>

<p>These berries must be stewed in order to be
acceptable. The fruit, after stewing, may be
rubbed through a sieve fine enough to keep
back the seeds, or it may be baked on crusts.
See <a href="#cherriesiv"><b>Cherries IV</b></a>.</p>


<h3>GRAPES</h3>

<p>This luscious fruit is at its best when served
fresh from the vines, with the bloom still on.
Never wash a bunch of grapes if it can be
avoided. Serve with grape scissors to cut the
bunches apart. People who fear appendicitis
may have the grapes squeezed from the skins
and the seeds afterwards removed. They are
very nice this way, with sugar and pounded
ice.</p>


<h3>GRAPEFRUIT</h3>

<p>A good grapefruit will have dark spots, a
skin which seems thin, will be firm to the
touch, and heavy for its size. To serve, cut
crosswise, and remove the white, bitter pulp
which is in the core, and separate the sections.
Fill the core with sugar and serve cold. A
little rum or kirsch may be added just before
serving, but, as George Ade said, &ldquo;A good girl
needs no help,&rdquo; and it is equally true of a
good grapefruit. If anybody knows why it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
called grapefruit, please write to the author of
this book in care of the publishers.</p>


<h3><a name="greengages" id="greengages"></a>GREEN GAGES</h3>

<p>Serve as they come, with the bloom on, or
peel, pit, and serve with cracked ice and powdered
sugar.</p>


<h3>HUCKLEBERRIES</h3>

<p>Look the fruit over carefully. Nothing
pleases a fly so much as to die and be mistaken
for a huckleberry. Serve with cracked ice,
with sugar or cream, or both.</p>


<h3>MUSKMELONS</h3>

<p>Keep on ice till the last moment. Cut crosswise,
take out the seeds with a spoon, and put
a cube of ice in each half. Green leaves on the
plate are a dainty touch.</p>


<h3><a name="oranges" id="oranges"></a>ORANGES</h3>

<p>Serve with fruit-knives, or in halves with
spoons&mdash;either the orange-spoon which comes
for that purpose, or a very heavy teaspoon.
Another way is to remove the peel, except a
strip an inch wide at the equator, cut at a
division line and straighten out the peel, taking
care not to break off the sections. Or, the fruit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
may be peeled, sliced, and served on plates with
sugar.</p>


<h3>PEACHES</h3>

<p>Wipe with a dry cloth and serve with fruit-knives.
Or, if you think much of your breakfast
napkins, peel and cut just before serving,
as they discolor quickly. Serve with cracked
ice, or with cream. Hard peaches may be
baked, as apples are, and served cold with
cream. Stewed peaches may be served on
crusts.</p>


<h3>PEARS</h3>

<p>Serve as they come, with fruit-knives. Hard
pears may be baked or stewed according to
directions previously given.</p>


<h3>PINEAPPLE</h3>

<p>Peel, cut out the eyes, and shred from the
core with a silver fork. Sprinkle with sugar
and keep on ice some hours before serving.
Pineapple is the only fruit known to have a
distinct digestive value, and it works most
readily on starches. It combines pleasantly
with bananas.</p>


<h3>PRUNELLES</h3>

<p>These are soaked, and boiled in the water in
in which they are soaked, with the addition of
a very little sugar. Dried apricots, blackberries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
cherries, nectarines, and prunes are cooked
in the same way. They may also be steamed
and afterwards sprinkled with sugar.</p>


<h3>PRUNES</h3>

<p>These are no longer despised since the price
has gone up, and the more expensive kinds are
well worth having. A bit of lemon-peel or
spice may flavor the syrup acceptably, and they
are especially healthful in combination with
cereals, according to recipes previously given.</p>


<h3>QUINCES</h3>

<p>Peel, stuff the cores with sugar, and bake according
to directions given for apples. A little
lemon may be used in the syrup for basting.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRIES AND STRAWBERRIES</h3>

<p>These delicious berries should not be washed
unless absolutely necessary, nor should they be
insulted with sugar and cream. If very sour,
strawberries may be dipped in powdered sugar.
Large, fine ones are served with the stems and
hulls on. Raspberries, if ripe, seldom need
sugar. Cracked ice is a pleasing accompaniment.</p>


<h3>RHUBARB</h3>

<p>I. Peel, cut into inch-lengths, and stew with
plenty of sugar. Serve cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
II. Cut, but do not peel, boil five minutes,
then change the water and cook slowly with
plenty of sugar till done.</p>

<p>III. <i>Baked.</i>&mdash;Do not peel. Cut into inch-pieces,
put into a buttered baking-dish or stone
jar, sprinkle plentifully with sugar, and bake
slowly. It will be a rich red in color.</p>

<p>IV. Cook on crusts. See <a href="#cherriesiv"><b>Cherries IV</b></a>.</p>

<p>V. Add a handful of seeded raisins to rhubarb
cooked in any of the above ways when it
is about half done. Figs, dates, and other dried
fruits, used with rhubarb, make a combination
pleasing to some.</p>


<h3>TANGERINES</h3>

<p>See <a href="#oranges"><b>Oranges</b></a>.</p>


<h3>WATERMELON</h3>

<p>Like muskmelon, watermelon must be very
thoroughly chilled. Serve in slices from a
platter or on individual plates, removing the
rind before serving, if desired; or cut the melon
in half, slice off the lower end so that it may
stand firmly, and serve the pulp from the shell
with a silver spoon. Ice pounded to snow is
a pleasant addition to any fruit, when the thermometer
is ninety-five or six in the shade.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span></p>

<h2>CEREALS</h2>


<p>So many breakfast foods are upon the market
that it would be impossible to enumerate all of
them, especially as new ones are appearing
continually. Full and complete directions for
cooking all of them are printed upon the packages
in which they are sold. It may not be
amiss to add, however, that in almost every instance,
twice or three times the time allowed
for cooking would improve the cereal in taste
and digestibility.</p>

<p>The uncooked cereals are many. A wise
housekeeper will use the uncooked cereals
when she has no maid. &ldquo;A word to the wise
is unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pleasing variety in the daily menu is secured
by getting a different cereal each time. In this
way, it takes about a year to get back to the
beginning again, and there is no chance to tire
of any of them.</p>

<p>Cereals should always be cooked in a double
boiler; and soaking over night in the water in
which they are to be cooked, where it is not
possible to secure the necessary time for long
cooking, will prove a distinct advantage. Leftover
cereals should be covered with cold water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
immediately, in the double boiler, and kept in
a cool place until the next day. Bring slowly
to a boil, and cook as usual. In the hot
weather, cereals may be cooked the day before
using, moulded in custard-cups, and kept in the
ice-box over night. They are very acceptable
when served ice-cold, and, if moulded with
fruit, or served with fruit on the same plate, so
much the better.</p>

<p>Pearled wheat, pearled barley, and coarse
hominy require five cupfuls of water to each
cup of cereal, and need from four to six hours&rsquo;
cooking. Coarse oatmeal and fine hominy must
be cooked from four to six hours, but need only
four cupfuls of water to each cup of cereal.
Rolled wheat and rolled barley are cooked two
hours in three times as much water as cereal;
rice and rolled oats, with three times as much
water, will cook in one hour. Farina, with six
cupfuls of water to each cupful of cereal, also
cooks in an hour; cerealine flakes cook in
thirty minutes, equal parts of water and cereal
being used.</p>

<p>Salt must be added just before cooking begins.
All cereals are richer if a little milk is added to
the water in which they are cooked.</p>

<p>To cook cereals in a double boiler, put the
water into the inner kettle, the outer vessel being
from half to two thirds full, and when it is
boiling furiously, sprinkle in the cereal, a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
grains at a time, and not so rapidly as to stop
the boiling. When cereals are eaten cold, they
require a little more liquid.</p>


<h4>BOILED BARLEY</h4>

<p>Wash the barley in several waters, cover with
cold water; bring to a boil, drain, cover with
fresh boiling water, add a little salt, and cook
slowly for four hours.</p>


<h4>BARLEY GRUEL</h4>

<p>Wash half a cupful of pearled barley in several
waters; put it into a double boiler with eight
cupfuls of water and half an inch of stick cinnamon.
Boil for two hours, strain, sweeten, and
add two wine glasses of port. Keep in a cool
place and reheat when required. An invaluable
breakfast cereal for a convalescent.</p>


<h4>STEAMED BARLEY</h4>

<p>Cooked one cupful of pearled barley in a
double boiler four hours, with four cupfuls of
water and a little salt. In the morning, add a
cupful of boiling water or milk, stir occasionally,
reheat thoroughly, and serve.</p>


<h4>BREWIS</h4>

<p>Dry bread in the oven so slowly that it is a
light brown in color. Crush into crumbs with the
rolling-pin and sift through the frying-basket.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
Measure the milk, salt it slightly, and bring to
a boil. Put in half as much of the dried crumbs.
Boil five or ten minutes, season with butter,
pepper, and salt, and serve at once with cream.
It must be stirred all the time it is cooking.
By omitting the butter, it may be served with
sugar. Brown, rye, graham, or corn bread may
be mixed with the white bread to advantage.
The dried and sifted crumbs of brown bread,
when served cold with cream, taste surprisingly
like a popular cereal which etiquette forbids us
to mention. This is a good way to use up
accumulated crumbs.</p>


<h4>CORN-MEAL MUSH</h4>

<p>The best meal comes from the South. It is
white, moist, and coarse, and is called &ldquo;water
ground.&rdquo; It is a very different proposition from
the dry, yellow powder sold in Northern groceries.
For mush, use four times as much water as
meal. Salt the water, and sprinkle in the meal
very slowly when it is at a galloping boil. Boil
an hour or more, stirring frequently. A better
mush is made by using half milk and half water.
Serve hot or cold with cream, or milk, and
sugar. If wanted for frying, wet a pan in cold
water, pour in the hot mush, and let cool.</p>


<h4>CORN AND WHEAT PORRIDGE</h4>

<p>Half a cupful of corn-meal and half a cupful
of flour. Make into a batter with cold water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
and put into two cupfuls of boiling water. Stir
often and cook half an hour or more, then add
four cupfuls of boiling milk. Cook half an hour
longer, stirring often. Serve hot or cold, with
cream and sugar.</p>


<h4>CORN MUSH OR HASTY PUDDING</h4>

<p>One cupful of corn-meal and one cupful of

<h2>SALT FISH</h2>


<p>With very, very few exceptions, fish and meats
other than salt are not suitable for breakfast.
So many delicious preparations of these are possible,
however, that no one need lament the
restriction which general use has made. The

many a dainty tidbit,&mdash;to make no invidious distinction,&mdash;and,
for some occult reason, the taste
craves salt in the morning.</p>

<p>Scrape and clean the fish, wipe dry and split,
laying flat upon a buttered gridiron. Broil

long cooking makes them tough.</p>


<h4>MINCED LAMB WITH POACHED EGGS</h4>

<p>Chop cold roast lamb very fine. Season with
salt, pepper, and a bit of mint. Reheat in the
gravy, or in water, adding a little butter, or

milk, and one egg. Put the milk on to boil,
add the rice, meat, and seasoning. When it
boils, add the egg, well beaten, and stir one
minute. Take from the fire, cool, form into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
small flat cakes, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry
brown. May be prepared the day before using.</p>

brought to the boil. Drain, wipe, trim
off the rind, roll in flour, and fry. When brown,

may also be dipped in egg and crumbs and
fried or broiled. Serve on a hot platter. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
sauce of melted butter, lemon-juice, and minced
parsley is a pleasing accompaniment.</p>


<h4>FRIED TRIPE</h4>

<p>Tripe as it comes from the market is already
prepared. Wash thoroughly, boil until tender,
drain, and cool. Cut into strips, season with salt
and pepper, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry in
butter or drippings until brown. It may be
prepared for frying the day before and kept in
a cool place. Breaded tripe may also be broiled
on a buttered gridiron.</p>


<h4>FRICASSEED TRIPE</h4>

<p>Cut a pound of tripe in narrow strips, add a
cupful of water, a piece of butter the size of an
egg, and a tablespoonful of flour, rubbed smooth
in a little cold water. Season with salt and
simmer thirty minutes. Serve very hot, on
toast if desired.</p>


<h4>TRIPE &Agrave; LA LYONNAISE</h4>

<p>One pound of cooked tripe cut into inch
squares, two tablespoonfuls of butter, one tablespoonful
of chopped onion, one tablespoonful
of vinegar, salt and pepper to taste. Put the
butter and onion in a frying-pan. When the
onion turns yellow, add the tripe and seasoning,
boil up once more, and serve immediately, on
toast.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span></p>

<h4>TRIPE &Agrave; LA POULETTE</h4>

<p>Fry a chopped onion in three tablespoonfuls
of butter. When brown, add a pound of tripe,
cut into dice, season with salt and paprika, and
fry until the mixture is partially dry. Add a
heaping tablespoonful of flour, and when the
butter has absorbed it, add slowly two cupfuls
of stock or milk and a slight grating of nutmeg.
Simmer till the tripe is tender. Beat together
one tablespoonful of melted butter and one
tablespoonful of lemon-juice, stir into the well-beaten
yolks of two eggs, take the tripe from
the fire, mix thoroughly, and serve at once.</p>


<h4>MINCED VEAL AND EGGS</h4>

<p>Chop cold cooked veal very fine. Add
hard-boiled eggs cut fine, one to each two cupfuls
of meat. Reheat in hot water, adding
melted butter, or in a cream sauce. A bit of
green pepper, parsley, grated onion, pimento,
or capers finely cut may be used for flavoring.
Other meats may be prepared in the same way.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span></p>

<h2>SUBSTITUTES FOR MEAT</h2>


<p>Certain things are well suited to replace meat
at the breakfast table. It is a good idea to bar
out the potato, unless in hash, for the simple
reason that the humble vegetable appears at
dinner about three hundred and sixty-five days
in the year, and even a good thing may be
worked to death. Americans have been accused,
not altogether unjustly, of being &ldquo;potato
mad.&rdquo; Potato left-overs can be used at
luncheon, if not in hash for breakfast.</p>


<h4>FRIED EGGPLANT</h4>

<p>Slice the eggplant in slices one third of an
inch thick, pare, put into a deep dish, and cover
with cold water well salted. Soak one hour.
Drain, wipe, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry
brown.</p>


<h4>BROILED MUSHROOMS</h4>

<p>Choose large, firm mushrooms. Remove the
stems, peel, wash, and wipe dry. Rub with
melted butter and broil. Serve with a sauce
made of melted butter, lemon-juice, and minced
parsley.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span></p>

<h4>FRIED MUSHROOMS</h4>

<p>Prepare as above, dip in egg and crumbs, and
fry in deep fat. Or saut&eacute; in butter in the frying-pan.
Breaded mushrooms may be broiled
if dipped in melted butter or oil before broiling.</p>


<h4>BAKED MUSHROOMS</h4>

<p>Prepare as above. Place in a shallow earthen
baking-dish, hollow side up, sprinkle with salt
and pepper, and place a small piece of butter on
each. Baste with melted butter and a few drops
of lemon-juice. Serve very hot, on buttered
toast.</p>


<h4>GRILLED MUSHROOMS</h4>

<p>Cut off the stalks, peel, and score lightly the
under side of large, firm, fresh mushrooms.
Sprinkle with pepper and salt and soak a few
moments in oil. Drain and broil. Serve with
lemon quarters and garnish with parsley.</p>


<h4>FRENCH TOAST</h4>

<p>Make a batter of two eggs, well beaten, a
cupful of milk, a tablespoonful of melted butter,
and spice or grated lemon- or orange-peel to
flavor. Dip the trimmed slices of bread in this
batter and fry brown in butter.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span></p>

<h4>CORN OYSTERS</h4>

<p>Two cupfuls of green corn, grated, half a cupful
of milk, one cupful of sifted flour, two eggs,
a teaspoonful of salt and one tablespoonful each
of butter and lard. Beat the yolks of the eggs,
add the milk, then the flour and salt. Beat to
a smooth batter, add the corn, then beat again,
adding the well beaten whites of the eggs last.
Put the lard and butter into a frying-pan, and
when very hot put in the batter by small
spoonfuls. Brown on one side, then turn. If
the batter is too thick, add a little more milk.
The thinner the batter, the more delicate and
tender the oysters will be. Canned corn may
be used, if it is chopped very fine, but it is not
so good. By scoring deeply with a sharp knife
each row of kernels on an ear of corn, the pulp
may be pressed out with a knife. The corn
may be cut from the cob and chopped, but the
better way is to press out the pulp.</p>


<p class="break">Regardless of the allurements of wood and
field, it is always safest to buy mushrooms at a
reliable market. So many people are now
making a business of raising them that they
are continually getting cheaper. The silver
spoon test is absolutely worthless. In fact, the
only sure test is the risky one: &ldquo;Eat it, and if
you live it&rsquo;s a mushroom&mdash;if you die it&rsquo;s a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
toadstool.&rdquo; However, when buying mushrooms
of a reliable dealer, one takes practically
no risk at all, and, even at the highest price, a
box of mushrooms is much cheaper than a
really nice funeral.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span></p>

<h2>EGGS</h2>


<p>Various rules have been given for testing the
freshness of eggs, but there is only one which
is reliable, and it is, perhaps, the most simple
of all. It is merely this: open the egg and
look at the contents in a strong light. It is
better to hold it near the eyes and at the same
time take a deep breath inward.</p>

<p>Strictly fresh eggs come from the country
sometimes with the date of their appearance
stamped indelibly in purple on the egg. This
is done by giving the hens chopped calendars
with their meals. Care should be taken, however,
to furnish this year&rsquo;s calendar. Nobody
wants an egg with a last-year&rsquo;s date on it and
the error is likely to disarrange the digestion
of the hen. Eggs flavored with onions or
tomatoes are secured by turning the hens into
a neighbor&rsquo;s vegetable garden. A certain florist
feeds his unsold roses to his hens and sells
rose-flavored eggs to his customers at a fancy
price. The hint is well worth remembering.
Violet-flavored eggs might be had, doubtless, in
the same way.</p>

<p>At a formal breakfast, all precautions should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
be taken to insure the freshness of the eggs.
A conscientious hostess would be very much
mortified if she served chicken out of its proper
course.</p>


<h4>POACHED EGGS</h4>

<p>Use a skillet, or muffin-rings placed in a pan
of water, not too deep. The water should
barely cover the eggs. Bring the water to the
boiling point, drop in the eggs carefully, one at
a time, and remove from the fire immediately.
Cover the pan and let stand until cooked. A
teaspoonful of lemon-juice or vinegar in the
water will keep the whites firm and preserve
the shape of the eggs. Poached eggs are usually
served on thin slices of buttered toast. Take
up with a skimmer and let drain thoroughly
before placing on the toast. Sprinkle with
salt and pepper. As every other writer who
has given directions for poaching eggs has said
that &ldquo;the beauty of a poached egg is for the
yolk to be seen blushing through the veiled
white,&rdquo; the author of this book will make no
allusion to it.</p>


<h4>SCRAMBLED EGGS</h4>

<p>Put two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter into
a frying-pan. When it sizzles, break into it
quickly six fresh eggs and mix thoroughly with
a silver spoon for two minutes without stopping.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
Season with salt and pepper and a slight grating
of nutmeg if desired. Scrambled eggs should
be thick and creamy.</p>


<h4><a name="scrambledeggsii" id="scrambledeggsii"></a>SCRAMBLED EGGS&mdash;II</h4>

<p>Beat the eggs thoroughly, add one teaspoonful
of cold water or milk for each egg and beat
again. Cook as above.</p>


<h4>SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH ASPARAGUS
TIPS</h4>

<p>Have one cupful of cold cooked asparagus
tips ready. In boiling asparagus its color will
keep better if the smallest possible pinch of
baking soda be added to the water. It should
be cooked quickly in an uncovered saucepan.
Prepare the eggs as for <a href="#scrambledeggsii"><b>Scrambled Eggs&mdash;II</b></a>,
and when they begin to thicken, put in the asparagus
tips and stir until the eggs are done.
One half cupful of the asparagus tips to each
three eggs is about the right proportion, but
more may be added if desired. In making
scrambles, allow one egg for each person and
one extra for each three persons.</p>


<h4>SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH DRIED BEEF</h4>

<p>One cupful of minced dried beef, which has
been soaked in boiling water for five minutes.
Put it into melted butter, stir till the butter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
sizzles, then pour over six or seven-well-beaten
eggs. Stir till the eggs are smooth and creamy.
Serve at once. Any scramble may be served on
toast if desired.</p>


<h4>FRIED EGGS</h4>

<p>Three tablespoonfuls of butter in the frying-pan.
When it sizzles, slip in the broken eggs
carefully, one at a time. Tip the pan and baste
with the melted butter while cooking. If
wanted crisp on both sides, turn the eggs over
when the under side is done. Wet in cold water
the saucer on which an egg is broken and the
egg will not stick to it, but will slip easily into
the pan. Olive oil may be used instead of butter,
but the pan must be covered during the
cooking, as the oil spatters.</p>


<h4>FRIED EGGS AU BEURRE NOIR</h4>

<p>Fry eggs as above, using butter or oil. When
done, skim out, add more butter or oil to that
in the pan, season with salt, pepper, vinegar,
or lemon-juice, and let brown. When the butter
is brown pour it over the fried eggs and
serve.</p>


<h4>EGGS &Agrave; LA CR&Ecirc;ME</h4>

<p>Make a cream sauce, using one tablespoonful
of butter, two of flour, two cupfuls of milk, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
pepper and salt to season. When the sauce is
thick and creamy, add hard-boiled eggs coarsely
chopped, and serve at once on toast. Sprinkle
with chopped parsley.</p>


<h4>EGGS &Agrave; LA TRIPE</h4>

<p>Fry two sliced onions in butter, but do not
brown. Stir in one cupful of milk or cream and
enough flour to thicken, rubbed smooth in a
little of the cream or milk. Season with salt,
white pepper, and a bit of grated nutmeg. Stir
till thick, then add eight hard-boiled eggs,
sliced crosswise. Heat thoroughly and serve.</p>


<h4>EGGS AU MIROIR</h4>

<p>Butter a stone platter that will stand the heat
of the oven. Break into it carefully enough
fresh eggs to cover it, taking care not to break
the yolks. Place in the oven till the eggs are
set. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and minced
parsley and serve at once.</p>


<h4>EGGS WITH CREAMED CELERY</h4>

<p>Make the cream sauce and put into it enough
boiled celery, coarsely cut, to serve as a vegetable.
Spread on buttered toast and lay a poached
egg on each slice. The tough, unsightly portions
of celery stalks may be used in this way.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHICKEN LIVER SCRAMBLE</h4>

<p>Use one cupful of chopped cooked chicken
livers and six or seven well-beaten eggs. Prepare
like other scrambles.</p>


<h4>CHEESE SCRAMBLE</h4>

break into it six fresh eggs, and place in
the oven till the eggs are set. Sprinkle with
salt and pepper, minced parsley, and sweet
green pepper.</p>


<h4>EGGS &Agrave; L&rsquo;AURORE</h4>

<p>Make the cream sauce and add to it the shredded
whites of six or eight hard-boiled eggs.
Spread on buttered toast and rub the yolks
through a sieve, sprinkling each slice of toast
with the powdered yolk. Sometimes called
&ldquo;Eggs &agrave; la Goldenrod.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>OYSTER SCRAMBLE</h4>

<p>One cupful of oysters, cut fine. Pour boiling
water over, drain on a fine sieve, and add six or

with eight well-beaten eggs. A little grated
onion is an improvement.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="baconscramble" id="baconscramble"></a>BACON SCRAMBLE</h4>

<p>Fry one cupful of shredded bacon until partially
cooked, drain off part of the fat, add six

stirring constantly. A little grated onion may
be added with the eggs.</p>


<h4>CRAB SCRAMBLE</h4>

<p>One cupful of cooked shredded crab-meat, six
or seven well-beaten eggs. Shredded green
peppers may be added at pleasure. The canned
crab-meat is nearly as good as the fresh.</p>


<h4>SHRIMP SCRAMBLE</h4>

<p>One cupful of finely cut cooked shrimps, six
or seven well-beaten eggs. Green peppers may
be added. Canned shrimps may be used.</p>

minced, mixed with six or seven well-beaten
eggs before cooking. Or, use uncooked sausage-meat
and prepare like <a href="#baconscramble"><b>Bacon Scramble</b></a>.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span></p>

<h4>SARDINE SCRAMBLE</h4>

<p>Add the juice of half a lemon to one cupful

instead of butter. Beat six or seven eggs thoroughly
and mix with the sardines before
cooking.</p>


<h4>TONGUE SCRAMBLE</h4>

<p>One cupful finely minced cooked tongue, six
or eight well-beaten eggs. Season with grated
onion, shredded green pepper, or minced
parsley.</p>


<h4>EGGS WITH FINE HERBS</h4>

<p>Use a heaping tablespoonful of minced parsley,
chives, and tarragon to eight well-beaten
eggs, mixing before putting into the hot butter.</p>


<h4>MEXICAN EGGS</h4>

<p>Split three sweet green peppers, lengthwise,
and take out the seeds. Fry two minutes in
very hot butter. Fry six very thin slices of
ham and place on slices of toast, lay the peppers
over the ham, and put a fried or a poached egg
on each slice.</p>


<h4>SPANISH EGGS</h4>

<p>Cook together one cupful of stewed and
strained tomato, one bean of garlic, finely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
minced, one chopped onion, and two sweet
green peppers, seeded and chopped. Cook
gently till reduced one half. Spread on thin
slices of toast and lay a fried or poached egg on
each slice.</p>


<h4>CREAMED CHICKEN AND POACHED
EGGS</h4>

<p>Make a cream sauce, add one cupful of
minced cooked chicken, spread on toast, and
lay a poached egg on each slice.</p>


<h4>BOILED EGGS&mdash;I</h4>

<p>Put the eggs into a saucepan of cold water
and bring to the boil. Boil one minute and
serve at once.</p>


<h4>BOILED EGGS&mdash;II</h4>

<p>Have a saucepan of water at a galloping boil.
Drop in the eggs carefully, cover, and let stand
till the eggs are cool enough to handle. They
will be perfectly cooked and much more easily
managed than if the shells were piping hot.</p>


<h4>EGGS IN CRUSTS</h4>

<p>Cut stale bread into slices an inch thick.
Scoop out the centres of each slice and remove
the crust. Rub with butter, drop an egg into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
each cavity, and put in a hot oven till the eggs
are set.</p>


<h4><a name="eggsinramekins" id="eggsinramekins"></a>EGGS IN RAMEKINS</h4>

<p>Butter ramekins or custard cups. Drop an
egg into each cup and place in a hot oven till
the egg is set. This method of cooking eggs
may be endlessly varied by filling the cups half
full of minced meat, fish, seasoned crumbs,
creamed vegetables, or anything else which
combines well with eggs. Anything used in a
scramble or an omelet may be placed in the
bottom of the ramekin. If too dry, moisten
with cream, milk, or water. The egg may be
sprinkled with crumbs and dotted with butter.
Grated cheese and minced parsley may be
added at pleasure. A &ldquo;left-over&rdquo; which is
otherwise hopeless may often be used advantageously
in a ramekin with an egg. The
small individual dishes are pleasing, when
served on a fresh doily. Lacking the individual
dishes, or for variety, a stoneware platter, or a
baking-dish may be half filled with the mixture
and the eggs broken on top.</p>


<h4>BAKED EGGS WITH CHEESE</h4>

<p>Make toast and hollow the slices slightly in
the centre. Mix grated cheese to a paste with
milk and spread over the toast. Arrange on a
stoneware platter or in a baking-dish, break an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
egg over each slice, sprinkle with more cheese,
and place in a hot oven till the eggs are set.</p>


<h4>BAKED EGGS WITH HAM</h4>

<p>Make the cream sauce and add to it one cupful
of cold cooked ham, finely minced. Butter
custard cups, break an egg into each, and stand
in a pan of hot water in the oven till the eggs
are firm. Spread the minced ham on a platter
or on slices of toast, and turn the eggs on to it.
Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and minced parsley.</p>


<h4>CODDLED EGGS</h4>

<p>Allow four tablespoonfuls of milk for each
egg. Beat together thoroughly, cook in a
double boiler till creamy, and serve on toast.</p>


<h4>EGGS AND MUSHROOMS<br />
(<i>May Irwin&rsquo;s Recipe</i>)</h4>

<p>One pound of fresh mushrooms cleaned well
in several waters, and wiped dry. Put into a
saucepan with two ounces of butter, half a teaspoonful
of salt, and a dash of white pepper.

into a shallow baking-dish, and break over
them six eggs. Sprinkle with stale bread
crumbs, dot with butter, dust with salt and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
pepper, and bake in a hot oven till the eggs are
set. Serve on buttered toast.</p>


<h4><a name="eggsinambush" id="eggsinambush"></a>EGGS IN AMBUSH</h4>

<p>Scoop out the crumb from stale rolls, first
cutting an even slice off the top. Toast or fry
the shells thus made, or rub freely with butter
and set into a piping hot oven until crisp and
brown. Drop a fresh egg into each shell, add
a little minced parsley or a teaspoonful of cream,
if desired, or any preferred seasoning of minced
fish, or meat, or vegetable. (See <a href="#eggsinramekins"><b>Eggs in Ramekins</b></a>.)
Bake in a hot oven till the eggs set, put
on the covers, and serve. A pleasant surprise
for the person who expects to find only a roll.</p>


<h4>EGGS &Agrave; LA MA&Icirc;TRE D&rsquo;H&Ocirc;TEL</h4>

<p>Make a sauce of half a cupful of melted
butter, the juice of half a lemon, and a teaspoonful

<h4>EGGS BAKED IN TOMATOES</h4>

<p>Cut off a slice from the top (blossom end), of
a small, ripe, well-shaped tomato. With a
silver spoon scoop out the pulp carefully,
sprinkle the inside with salt and drain for a
few moments, upside down. Put a tablespoonful
of seasoned bread crumbs in the bottom of
the tomato, break a fresh egg into it, sprinkle
with salt and pepper, and place in a hot oven
until the egg is set. Prepare one tomato for
each person.</p>


<h4>SWISS EGGS</h4>

<p>Rub a stoneware platter thickly with butter,
cover it with very thin slices of fresh Gruy&egrave;re
cheese, break fresh eggs upon the cheese,
sprinkle with grated nutmeg, pepper, and salt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
pour half a cupful of cream over the eggs,
sprinkle with the cheese, grated, and bake
about a quarter of an hour in a hot oven.
Serve on the same platter on which the eggs
were baked.</p>


<h4>CHICKEN SCRAMBLE</h4>

<p>Use one cupful of cold cooked chicken,
shredded or chopped, to seven well-beaten
eggs, and prepare like other scrambles. A bit
of green pepper or of chopped pimento is an
agreeable addition.</p>


<h4>EGGS &Agrave; LA BONNE FEMME</h4>

<p>Fry two sliced onions brown in butter, then
add a tablespoonful of vinegar. Butter a platter,
spread the fried onions over it, break upon

<h2>OMELETS</h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<i>To make an omelet, you must first break
eggs.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<i>French Proverb.</i></p>


<p>So many different methods for making omelets
are given, in works of recognized authority,
that it seems as if any one who had an egg and
an omelet pan could hardly go amiss. Yet
failures are frequent, as every omelet-maker
knows.</p>

<p>French writers say positively that no liquid
of any sort must be added to an omelet&mdash;that
it contains eggs and eggs alone, beaten just
enough to break the yolks. American authorities
add milk or water, or beat the eggs separately,
the whites to a stiff froth. One of them
makes a clear distinction between an omelet
and a puffy omelet; the puffy omelet, of course,
being made by folding in the stiffly beaten
whites before cooking. Some say milk makes
it tough, and others say water makes it stringy.
Suffice it to say, however, that a perfect omelet
is a matter of experience and a deft hand. All
writers agree that small omelets are more easily
made than large ones, and it is better to do it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
twice or even three times than to have too many
eggs in one omelet. Below are given the
various methods, from which the would-be
omelet-maker may choose. All of them have
the stamp of good authority.</p>


<h4><a name="omeleti" id="omeleti"></a>OMELET&mdash;I</h4>

<p>Beat six eggs well, yolks and whites together.
Put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a frying-pan.
When it is hot, pour in the beaten eggs,
which have been seasoned with salt and pepper.
With a fork, draw the cooked egg from the
outside of the pan to the centre. As soon as it
is all thick, lift half of the omelet on to a plate,
and turn the other half over it. It should be
turned while the centre is still soft, and the fire
should not be too hot.</p>


<h4>OMELET&mdash;II</h4>

<p>Break the eggs into a bowl, add as many
tablespoonfuls of cold water as there are eggs.
Beat the eggs well, then season with salt and
pepper, and pour into a thin, smooth frying-pan
which contains a tablespoonful of melted butter.
With a thin knife lift the cooked portion of the
egg and allow the uncooked portion to run
down into the butter, meanwhile gently rocking
the pan back and forth. When creamy,
begin at the side of the pan nearest the handle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
and roll the omelet, using a little butter if
needed.</p>


<h4>OMELET&mdash;III</h4>

<p>Prepare as above, using milk instead of
water.</p>


<h4>OMELET&mdash;IV</h4>

<p>Separate the whites and yolks of the eggs.
Beat the yolks till thick and lemon colored and
the whites until they stand alone. Fold together
carefully, seasoning with salt and pepper,
and adding a tablespoonful of cold water for
each egg. Have two tablespoonfuls of butter
in the frying-pan. When it is hot, pour in the
egg mixture and let stand until the egg is set
around the edge and a knife plunged into the
centre comes out nearly clean. Then set the
pan into the oven till the omelet puffs. Score
slightly across the middle with a sharp knife,
fold, and serve at once on a hot platter.</p>


<h4>OMELET AUX FINES HERBES</h4>

<p>Prepare <a href="#omeleti"><b>Omelet I</b></a>, and mix a tablespoonful

before cooking.</p>

outermost half of the omelet, so that the other
portion will fold over it. Finish as usual.</p>

<h4>POTATO OMELET</h4>

<p>One cupful of cooked potatoes, creamed or
fried, cut in dice. Spread on half the omelet,
sprinkle with salt, pepper, and minced parsley,
and fold.</p>


<p class="break">Almost any left-over can be advantageously
used in an omelet. Fish, especially salt fish,
meats, and vegetables, in quantities of half a
cupful or more, preserved and fresh fruits,
cereals&mdash;everything but soups, salads, and
puddings. Roughly speaking, any omelet mixture
can be added to the eggs before cooking,
but as a general rule, it is better to spread it on
half of the omelet and fold the other half over
it, as otherwise the omelet is more likely to be
heavy.</p>

<p>Sweet omelets are delicious. A teaspoonful
of powdered sugar should be added to the eggs
before cooking, and the fruit, jam, jelly, or
preserves should be very thinly spread, as flavor
is desired, not a dessert. Fresh fruits are cut
fine and sprinkled with powdered sugar, spread
on half the omelet, and the other half folded
over. In the case of juicy fruits, such as
oranges, the juice of the fruit is carefully saved
and poured over the folded omelet just before
serving.</p>

<p>Among the fresh fruits suitable for omelets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
are Apricots, Bananas, Blackberries, Cherries,
Gooseberries, Grapefruit, Plums, Huckleberries,
Oranges, Pineapples, Peaches, Raspberries,
and Strawberries&mdash;all crushed very fine
and sweetened; the juice, if any, being poured
over the omelet.</p>

<p>Among the stewed and preserved fruits are
Apples, Apricots, Cherries, Currants, Figs,
Gooseberries, Peaches, Pears, Plums, Quinces,
Rhubarb, and the various fruit jams. Rum or
brandy poured over the omelet and set on fire
just before serving is a pleasant addition to
many of the fruit omelets, Fig especially.</p>

<h2>QUICK BREADS</h2>


<p>People who can eat hot breads for breakfast
are always sorry for those who cannot. Quite
often the internal dissension ascribed to the hot
bread is due to something else, or to an undesirable
combination of food elements in one
and the same meal. Besides, hot bread is so
good that it is sometimes eaten too quickly.
This hint is of medical origin and is worth consideration.
Almost any hot bread will be found
harmless when baked a second time.</p>

granular, like corn-meal. Add cold sweet milk
to make a dough as soft as can be handled, roll
out an inch thick, cut into rounds with a biscuit
cutter, and bake in a hot oven. The dough
must be handled as little as possible after
putting in the milk.</p>

taken for rising, there are ways in which the
time can be considerably shortened.</p>

<p>A competent authority says that any mixture
for rolls or muffins can be made ready for its
second rising at night, and kept over night in
any place where the dough will not freeze, or
where the temperature is not so high as to
cause too rapid rising and consequent souring
of the dough.</p>

<p>Moreover, rolls or muffins may be baked in
the afternoon until done thoroughly, but not
brown, wrapped in a cloth, and put away in a
cool place. In the morning, they need only to
be rubbed with melted butter and set into a hot
oven for a very few moments. They will come
out crisp and flaky, and free from all objections
on the score of indigestibility. Bread twice
baked is always much more digestible than
fresh bread.</p>

<p>Brioche, the most delicious of all hot breads,
needs to stand in the refrigerator over night,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
and the second process is a quick one when the
paste is once made. The paste will keep a
week or more in a very cold place, and be the
better for it. It is a French dough, for which
many complicated recipes are given, but the
following will be found satisfactory, and not
difficult after one or two trials.</p>


<h4>BRIOCHE PASTE</h4>

<p>One cake of compressed yeast, a pinch of
salt, one and one fourth cupfuls of butter, four
cupfuls of flour, one tablespoonful of sugar,
two tablespoonfuls of warm water, and seven
eggs. Dissolve the yeast in the water, adding
a little more water if necessary, and rubbing
the yeast cake with a spoon until thoroughly
dissolved. Stir in enough sifted flour to make
a stiff dough, rolling and patting with the hands
until thoroughly mixed. Drop this ball of paste
into a kettle of warm water and let stand in
a moderate temperature until it has a little
more than doubled in bulk. (Some recipes for
Brioche say that the ball of paste should be light
enough to float.) Put the remainder of the four
cupfuls of flour into a mixing bowl, add the
sugar, salt, and butter, softened but not melted,
and four of the eggs, unbeaten. With the
hand mix carefully to a paste, beat smooth,
and add the rest of the eggs, unbeaten, one at
a time. Take the ball of paste, when light,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
out of the warm water with a skimmer, and,
still using the hand, incorporate it carefully
with the egg mixture, folding the two together
as lightly as possible. Let rise, in a moderate
temperature, until double in bulk. Then turn
the paste on a floured board and pat and fold
with the hands until smooth in texture and inclined
to stay in shape. Let rise once more
until very light, then put into the refrigerator
and let stand over night.</p>


<h4>BRIOCHE ROLLS</h4>

<p>Roll a large lump of Brioche dough into a
thin sheet on a floured board or pastry slab,
working lightly and quickly, spread with softened
butter, and fold so that the paste will
be in three layers. Cut in strips an inch wide
and twist, working from the ends, and arrange
in circles on a baking-sheet, the ends of the
strips pointing inward. The rolls should be
very close together in the pan. Beat the yolk
of an egg, dilute it with as much milk, and
brush the rolls with the mixture. Let them
rise a few minutes, then bake about half an
hour in a moderate oven. A little sugar and
water may be spread over the tops if desired.</p>


<h4>BRIOCHE BUNS</h4>

<p>Shape the chilled paste into small balls, and
put a bit of citron or a few raisins on the top of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
each one. Let rise a few moments and bake
half an hour in a moderate oven.</p>


<h4>BRIOCHE BREAKFAST CAKE</h4>

<p>Butter a round cake-tin which has a tube in
the centre, fill it half full of chilled Brioche
paste, and let rise till the pan is two thirds full.
Bake in a moderate oven and turn out. It
should be torn apart with the fingers&mdash;not cut.</p>


<h4>BATH BUNS</h4>

<p>Dissolve a cake of yeast in two cupfuls of
warm water. Add enough flour to make a
moderately stiff sponge, let rise about two
hours. Cream together one half cupful each
of butter and sugar, add one cupful of lukewarm
milk, a pinch of salt, and two eggs, well
beaten. Mix with the sponge, let rise an hour
longer, then knead, shape into buns, arrange
close together in a baking-pan, and let rise till
very light. Bake in a moderate oven.</p>

<h4>ENGLISH BATH BUNS</h4>

<p>Dissolve half a cake of compressed yeast in
one cupful of milk, and add two cupfuls of flour,
or enough to make a sponge. Let rise until
light, then add two thirds of a cupful of melted
butter and four eggs, well beaten. Knead and
let rise again for about an hour. Make into
balls the size of a small apple and press into
each one some currants and bits of candied peel.
Let rise ten or fifteen minutes in a warm place,
sprinkle with sugar, and bake.</p>


<h4>HOT CROSS BUNS</h4>

<p>Rub one half cupful of butter into eight cupfuls
of sifted flour, then add half a cake of
compressed yeast dissolved in three cupfuls of
scalded milk. Let rise two hours. Work into
the sponge one cupful of sugar, one cupful of
cleaned currants, and half a nutmeg grated.
Knead, shape into buns, arrange in pans, score
deeply with a cross, brush with butter, and let
rise fifteen minutes. Bake forty-five minutes
in a brisk oven. This is the genuine English
recipe, and the buns are good at any time, but
the cross is made only on Good Friday, or for
Easter.</p>


<h4>RISEN MUSH MUFFINS</h4>

<p>One cupful of hominy, cerealine, corn-meal
mush, oatmeal, rice, or other left-over cooked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
cereal, one teaspoonful of butter, one tablespoonful
of sugar, one pinch of salt, one fourth
of a cake of yeast (compressed) dissolved in
one cupful of scalded milk, and two cupfuls of
sifted flour. Mix thoroughly and let rise over
night. In the morning, beat well and fill well-buttered
muffin-pans half full. Let rise until
double in bulk, then bake half an hour.</p>


<h4>FINGER ROLLS</h4>

<p>Mix one cupful of scalded milk with one
tablespoonful of butter. When cool, add a
teaspoonful of sugar, a pinch of salt, and one
half cake of yeast dissolved in half a cupful of
warm water. Add enough flour to make a soft
dough&mdash;about three cupfuls. Mix thoroughly,
knead for fifteen minutes, and set to rise in a
warm place for three or four hours. When
light, knead again, shape into balls, and roll
into cylinders on a floured board, pointing the
ends. Arrange in a shallow pan, and let rise
until double in size&mdash;about an hour&mdash;glaze with
beaten egg, and bake fifteen minutes in a hot
oven.</p>


<h4>SOUTHERN ROLLS</h4>

<p>Six cupfuls of flour, two eggs, one cake of
compressed yeast, one cupful of milk, two
tablespoonfuls of lard, melted, and a teaspoonful
of salt. Mix as other sponges, let rise five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
hours, knead, shape into rolls, let rise two hours
longer, and bake about twenty minutes.</p>


<h4>FRENCH ROLLS</h4>

<p>Eight cupfuls of flour, four eggs, four teaspoonfuls
of sugar, one tablespoonful of butter,
one cake of compressed yeast dissolved in two
cupfuls of milk. Mix like other sponges, let
rise until light, knead, shape, let rise the second
time, and bake in a moderate oven.</p>


<h4>KENTUCKY ROLLS</h4>

<p>Four cupfuls of flour, one tablespoonful of
sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, two eggs, half a
cupful of lard, and half a cake of compressed
yeast. Mix the lard, sugar, and flour, then stir
in the other ingredients, the yeast being dissolved
in a little water, and add enough milk
or warm water to make a thin batter. Let rise
in a warm place, then add enough flour to make
a stiff dough, and let rise again. When light,
knead, shape, and put to rise for a third time.
Bake in a quick oven.</p>


<h4>ALABAMA ROLLS</h4>

<p>Rub two hot baked potatoes through a colander.
Stir in one cupful of melted butter, two
eggs well beaten, half a cake of compressed
yeast, dissolved, and mixed with one cupful of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
sifted flour. Work with the hand into a smooth
sponge, and let rise three hours. Then work
into the sponge two cupfuls of sifted flour and
let rise five hours longer. Knead, make into
roll shape, set to rise two hours more, and bake.</p>


<h4>CORN ROLLS</h4>

<p>To four cupfuls of well-salted hot corn-meal
mush add one cupful of mixed butter and lard
and half a cupful of sugar. When cool, add one
cake of compressed yeast dissolved in a little
warm water, and set to rise in a warm place.
When light, work in enough sifted flour to make
a stiff dough, knead thoroughly, and let rise
again. Late at night, knead again and set in a
cool place over night. In the morning, roll and
cut out like biscuit. Spread half of each circle
with softened butter and roll the other half
over it. Let rise a few moments and bake. If
the weather is very warm, add a teaspoonful of
soda, dissolved in a little warm water, to the
sponge.</p>


<h4>PARKER HOUSE ROLLS</h4>

<p>Dissolve one cake of compressed yeast in one
cupful of lukewarm water, and add enough flour
to make a thin batter. Put this sponge in a
warm place to rise. Add one tablespoonful of
lard, one tablespoonful of butter, two tablespoonfuls
of sugar, and one teaspoonful of salt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
to two cupfuls of milk, and bring to the boil.
Take from the fire and let cool. When the
sponge is light stir in the milk, and add enough
sifted flour to make a dough, usually about
eight cupfuls, though the thickening qualities
of various brands of flour vary greatly. Knead
for fifteen or twenty minutes, then set to rise
until very light. Shape, place in a baking-pan,
let rise once more, and when light bake in a
quick oven.</p>


<h4>WHOLE WHEAT ROLLS</h4>

<p>One teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of
sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, one cake
of compressed yeast, one cupful of scalded milk,
and three cupfuls of whole wheat flour. Add
the salt, sugar, and butter to the scalded milk.
Dissolve the yeast in two tablespoonfuls of warm
water and add to the milk when it has cooled.
Add half of the flour and beat hard for ten minutes,
then work in the rest of the flour. Set it
to rise for two hours. Roll out into a sheet an
inch thick and cut into small rolls. Place close
together in a well-buttered baking-pan, and let
rise from fifteen to thirty minutes. Bake fifteen
or twenty minutes in a quick oven. Brush with
an egg-white beaten with a little milk if a
glossy surface is desired. This should be done
about ten minutes before taking out of the
oven.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span></p>

<h4>SWEDISH ROLLS</h4>

<p>Use any plain roll mixture. When shaping
for the last rising, roll the dough very thin,
spread with softened butter, sprinkle with sugar
and cinnamon, and add a few cleaned currants,
bits of citron, and stoned raisins. Roll the
dough like jelly cake, cut in half-inch slices
from the ends, arrange flat in a well-buttered
pan, let rise until double in bulk, and bake as
usual.</p>


<h4>PARIS ROLLS</h4>

<p>Four cupfuls of milk, one half cake of compressed
yeast, six cupfuls of flour, and the yolks
of two eggs, well beaten. Mix thoroughly and
set the sponge to rise. When it is very light,
work into it two tablespoonfuls of melted butter,
one whole egg, well beaten, one teaspoonful of
salt, and half a teaspoonful of baking soda dissolved
in hot water, one tablespoonful of white
sugar, and enough sifted flour to make a soft
dough. Let rise five hours. Roll out, shape
into balls, score each one deeply crosswise with
a sharp knife, and arrange close together in a
well-buttered baking-pan. Let rise for an hour
or more and bake about half an hour. This
recipe makes a large number of rolls. They
may be taken from the oven when beginning
to turn brown and wrapped in a cloth. Five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
minutes in a hot oven, if brushed first with
melted butter, will render them crisp, flaky, and
very digestible.</p>


<h4>RUSK</h4>

<p>Two cupfuls of flour, two cupfuls of sugar,
one cupful of melted lard, half a cake of compressed
yeast, dissolved in a little warm water,
and three cupfuls of lukewarm water. Make
into a batter, let rise all day in a warm place.
At night work into the sponge six cupfuls of
sifted flour and two eggs, well beaten. Let rise
over night in a moderately cool place. In the
morning, shape the dough into rolls, let rise a
few minutes in a warm place, and bake. The
dough should be soft. These rolls may be
sprinkled with sugar and spice.</p>


<h4>GEORGIA RUSK</h4>

<p>One cupful of milk, scalded and cooled, one
tablespoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt,
one quarter of a cake of compressed yeast, dissolved
in the milk, and two cupfuls of sifted
flour. Set the sponge, and, when light, work
into it half a cupful of melted butter, half a cupful
of sugar, and one well-beaten egg. When
very light, shape into small pointed rolls and
let rise again. Brush with milk and egg and
sprinkle with sugar just before baking.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span></p>

<h4>SOUTHERN SALLY LUNN</h4>

<p>Four cupfuls of flour, three eggs, one teaspoonful
of butter, one cake of compressed
yeast, and two cupfuls of milk. Beat the yolks
of the eggs until very light. Stir in the butter,
flour, and milk, the yeast being dissolved in the
milk. Beat the whites to a stiff froth and add
last. Set to rise, and when light bake in well-buttered
muffin-tins.</p>


<h4>SOUTHERN SALLY LUNN&mdash;II</h4>

<p>Four cupfuls of flour, one teaspoonful of
salt, two cupfuls of milk, one half cupful
of sugar, and one cake of compressed yeast,
dissolved in the milk. Make a batter and
let rise in a warm place about three hours.
Then work into it gradually five eggs, beaten
separately, and one half cupful of melted butter.
Add flour enough to make a stiff batter, fill buttered
muffin-tins two thirds full, let rise, and
bake.</p>


<h4>SOUTHERN SALLY LUNN&mdash;III</h4>

<p>Three cupfuls of flour, three eggs, one cake of
compressed yeast dissolved in two cupfuls of
milk, one half cupful of melted butter, and
one tablespoonful of sugar. Beat well together
into a stiff batter and let rise five or six hours.
Then add a little warm water in which half a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
teaspoonful of baking soda has been dissolved,
and pour the batter into a well-buttered cake-pan
having a tube in the centre. Bake about three
quarters of an hour and serve hot. It should
be torn apart, not cut.</p>


<h4>ZWIEBACK</h4>

<p>One cake of compressed yeast dissolved in
one cupful of scalded milk, a pinch of salt, and
enough sifted flour to make a soft dough. Let
rise until very light, then stir in one fourth of
a cupful of melted butter, one fourth of a cupful
of sugar, and one unbeaten egg. Mix thoroughly,
and sift in enough more flour to make
a smooth, elastic dough. Shape into a loaf and
let rise until very light. A Russian-iron bread-pan
holding one loaf is best for Zwieback. Let
it rise once more until very light, then bake in
a quick oven. Glaze with sugar dissolved in
milk just before taking from the oven. When
the loaf is cold, cut in half-inch slices and place
in an open oven until golden-brown, dry, and
crisp.</p>

<h2>PANCAKES</h2>


<p>The edible varieties of pancakes are readily
distinguished from the poisonous growths. The
harmless ones are healthful and nutritious and
grow in private kitchens. The dark, soggy,
leaden varieties are usually to be found in restaurants,
but have been known to flourish in
private kitchens also.</p>

<p>Batter for pancakes should be thoroughly
beaten. A soapstone griddle is best, but an
iron one will do, and many a savory pancake
has come from a humble frying-pan. A pancake
turner is essential, and no pancake should
be turned more than once, as twice turning
makes a soggy pancake from the most promising
batter. In the following recipes, where
exact proportions are given, they are not arbitrary
as regards flour. The thickening properties
of various brands of flour vary so much that
no exact rule can be given. A perfect pancake
batter will be smooth, light in texture, seem
somewhat elastic to the touch of the mixing
spoon, and will keep its shape on a griddle.
Batter enough for one pancake should be dipped
from the bowl with a cup or large spoon, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
adding uncooked batter to that on the griddle
even an instant after it has begun to cook will
work disaster to the pancake&mdash;and the hapless
mortal who eats it.</p>

<p>Maple syrup is the syrup <i>par excellence</i> for
pancakes and waffles, but alas, it is difficult to
procure. Much of it is made from corn cobs
and molasses, sealed in tin cans bearing gaudy
labels, and, sailing under false colors, is sold to
the trusting consumer at a high price.</p>

<p>Even the bricks of maple sugar are not
wholly trustworthy, though, as a rule, a better
quality of syrup can be obtained by making it
at home from the bricks. The ordinary adulterants
cannot so readily be added to a crystallized
as to a liquid product, though promising
maple bricks are often made of brown sugar
flavored with a little maple syrup.</p>

<p>Other syrups can be made easily and may
possibly give welcome variety even to those
fortunates who can secure the real maple syrup.
Maraschino, noyeau, kirsch, and other cordials,
orange-flower water, grated orange- and lemon-peel,
and the fruit juices left from canned and
preserved fruits, can all be used to advantage
in flavoring a simple syrup made of sugar
and water boiled till it hairs from the spoon.
Always add flavoring to syrup just before
taking it from the fire, and do not allow it to
boil.</p>

yeast dissolved in lukewarm water, and
one tablespoonful of molasses. Beat well together
and let stand over night. Fry on a
soapstone griddle greased with suet, salt pork,
or bacon. A bit of suet or salt pork tied in a bit
of cloth was the old-fashioned method of greasing
a griddle for buckwheat cakes.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span></p>

butter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one teaspoonful
of salt, and three eggs. Add the melted butter
to the corn-meal, boil the milk and pour it,
scalding hot, over the corn-meal. Sift the dry
ingredients together, and after the meal and
milk have cooled stir the dry mixture into it.
Add the well-beaten eggs last, beat hard, and
bake like other griddle cakes.</p>


<h4>CORN-MEAL PANCAKES&mdash;II</h4>

<p>Two cupfuls of corn-meal, one cupful of flour,
one tablespoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of
salt, one teaspoonful of soda, one tablespoonful
of melted butter, three eggs, and sour milk to
thin the batter. Scald the meal with enough

and add to the meal. Add the eggs, beaten
separately, the whites to a stiff froth, and the
soda dissolved in a teaspoonful of warm water.
Thin the batter with enough sour milk to make
it of the right consistency and bake like other
pancakes.</p>


<h4>CORN-MEAL FLAPJACKS</h4>

<p>Two cupfuls of corn-meal, one cupful of buttermilk,
half a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful
of soda, half a cupful of boiling water,
and one egg, well beaten. Mix the salt with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
the meal, pour over the boiling water, mix thoroughly

make a thin batter.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span></p>

<h4>FLANNEL CAKES</h4>

<p>Beat two eggs thoroughly. Add one teaspoonful
of salt, one tablespoonful of sugar,
three cupfuls of milk, and enough flour, sifted
in with one teaspoonful of cream tartar and
half a teaspoonful of soda, to make a thin batter.
Bake on a greased griddle, butter, and
serve very hot.</p>


<h4>FRENCH PANCAKES</h4>

<p>One and one half cupfuls of flour, one and
one half cupfuls of milk, one teaspoonful each
of salt and melted butter, two teaspoonfuls of
brandy, and four eggs. Beat the yolks of the
eggs till light-colored and creamy, add the other
ingredients gradually and fold in the stiffly
beaten whites last. Fry in a very hot frying-pan,
using equal parts of lard and butter to fry
in. Bake in small cakes, and after taking up
spread very thinly with marmalade, honey, or
jam, and roll up like a jelly roll. Sift powdered
sugar over the rolls and serve at once, without
butter or syrup.</p>


<h4>FEATHER PANCAKES</h4>

<p>Scald two cupfuls of milk, dissolve in it one
half cake of compressed yeast, and add a teaspoonful

<h4>FRUIT PANCAKES</h4>

<p>Add apple sauce, berries, chopped dates, figs
or prunes, orange marmalade, chopped preserved
quinces, or any desired fresh fruit or
preserves to any good pancake batter, in the
proportion of one heaping tablespoonful of fruit
to each cupful of batter. The grated pineapple
which comes in cans is particularly satisfactory
and needs no further preparation. The fruit
juice, sweetened, should be used instead of
syrup wherever possible.</p>


<h4>GRAHAM GRIDDLE CAKES</h4>

<p>One cupful of wheat flour and one cupful of
Graham flour, sifted with one teaspoonful of salt
and one tablespoonful of sugar. Beat two eggs

enough flour for a batter. Scald the milk and
cool it, then dissolve the yeast in it and add
the salt and sugar. Add enough sifted flour to
make a smooth, thin batter, cover, and let
stand over night in a warm place. In the
morning add the melted butter, the soda dissolved

stiff froth. Use only enough butter to keep the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
cakes from sticking to the griddle and serve as
soon as done.</p>

of melted butter and one tablespoonful
of sugar. Beat until thoroughly mixed, with two
cupfuls of milk and a tablespoonful of baking
powder, then add three eggs, beaten separately,

of cream may be used instead of the butter.</p>


<h4>RICE PANCAKES&mdash;III</h4>

<p>Dissolve a teaspoonful of soda in a tablespoonful
of cold water, and stir it into two cupfuls
of thick sour milk. Add two cupfuls of
sifted flour, a pinch of salt, two eggs, beaten
separately, and one cupful of cold boiled rice.
Fry brown on a well-greased griddle.</p>


<h4>STRAWBERRY PANCAKES</h4>

<p>Six eggs, beaten separately, two cupfuls of
milk, two cupfuls of sifted flour, and one teaspoonful
of salt. Mix the flour and salt, then

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
fold in the whites, beaten to a stiff froth. Bake
on a well-greased griddle and serve two to each
person, with butter and crushed and sweetened
strawberries between. Sprinkle with powdered
sugar. Half this recipe is sufficient for a small
family.</p>


<h4>SOUR MILK PANCAKES</h4>

<p>Two cupfuls of sour milk, two and one half
cupfuls of sifted flour, one teaspoonful of soda,
one tablespoonful of warm water, one teaspoonful

dissolved in warm water, then the melted butter,
then the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs.
Fold together carefully and bake at once.</p>


<h4>SOUR MILK PANCAKES&mdash;II</h4>

<p>To four cupfuls of sour milk add enough flour
to make a batter that will pour, sifted in gradually
and thoroughly mixed. Add two eggs,
well beaten, one tablespoonful of melted butter,
one teaspoonful of salt, and a teaspoonful
of soda dissolved in a little warm water. Bake

<h4>WHEAT PANCAKES</h4>

<p>Three cupfuls of flour, two cupfuls of milk,
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one tablespoonful
of melted butter, three eggs, and one
teaspoonful of salt. Sift the dry ingredients
together. Beat the yolks of the eggs till light-colored
and creamy and stir into the milk.
Mix with the flour, then add the melted butter
and beat to a smooth batter. Add a little more
milk if the batter seems too thick. Add the
whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth, fold
in carefully, and bake as usual.</p>


<h4>WHEAT PANCAKES&mdash;II</h4>

<p>Three cupfuls of milk, two cupfuls of sifted
flour, three eggs, one pinch of salt, and two
heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Beat
the yolks of the eggs till light-colored and
creamy, and mix thoroughly with the milk.
Put the flour in a bowl and pour on a part of
the milk, making a thick batter. Beat this
thick batter hard until very smooth, dissolve
the baking powder in the rest of the milk and
add it, beating thoroughly, and add the stiffly
beaten whites of the eggs last. This batter
may be used for waffles. The thinner it is the
more delicate the cakes will be.</p>

out with a small cake cutter which has a hole
in the centre, and fry in very hot lard. Drain
on brown paper and sprinkle with powdered
sugar.</p>


<h4>PLAIN DOUGHNUTS</h4>

<p>Sift two teaspoonfuls of baking powder with
four cupfuls of flour. Dissolve half a cupful
of sugar in one cupful of milk. Add to the
milk one teaspoonful of salt, half a nutmeg,
grated, and two well-beaten eggs. Combine

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
cupfuls. Roll very thin, cut out, fry in smoking-hot
fat, and drain on brown paper. This
recipe makes about five dozen doughnuts, and

<p>Sift together one cupful of flour, three tablespoonfuls
of corn starch, and a pinch of salt.
Mix one egg, well beaten, one scant teaspoonful
of soda, and two cupfuls of sour milk together
and gradually combine mixtures, beating hard
meanwhile. Bake in hot, well-greased waffle-irons
and butter the waffles before serving.</p>


<h4>FEATHER WAFFLES</h4>

<p>Four cupfuls of milk, three eggs, beaten separately.
Add the milk to the yolks and a pinch
of salt, then add one and one half tablespoonfuls
of rich cream or melted butter and sifted flour
enough to make the batter a little stiffer than
pancake batter. Add the whites of the eggs
last, beaten to a stiff froth, and stir in quickly
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder.</p>


<h4>GEORGIA WAFFLES</h4>

<p>Two cupfuls of flour, a pinch of salt, two cupfuls
of buttermilk, one cupful of melted lard,
one scant teaspoonful of soda, and one egg.
Sift the flour and salt together and beat into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
smooth batter with the buttermilk. Add the
well-beaten egg, then the hot lard, beat thoroughly,
add the dry soda, beat hard for a minute
or two, and bake in hissing-hot waffle-irons.</p>


<h4>HOMINY WAFFLES</h4>

<p>One cupful of cold cooked hominy, one egg,
well beaten, one tablespoonful of melted butter,
one pinch of salt, two cupfuls of milk, and
two cupfuls of flour sifted with one teaspoonful
of baking powder. Mix thoroughly and
bake in very hot waffle-irons, well buttered.</p>


<h4>RAISED HOMINY WAFFLES</h4>

<p>To one cupful of cold cooked hominy add two
cupfuls of scalded milk in which one half a yeast
cake has been dissolved, one tablespoonful of
butter, melted, a pinch of salt, one tablespoonful
of sugar, and two cupfuls of flour. Mix
thoroughly and set to rise over night. In the
morning add two eggs, beaten separately, folding
in the stiffly beaten whites last. Bake in
very hot, well-greased irons.</p>


<h4>INDIAN WAFFLES</h4>

<p>One cupful each of flour and corn-meal, two
cupfuls of thick sour milk, one cupful of sour
cream, half a teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful
of soda, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
eggs, beaten separately, the stiffly beaten whites
being folded in last. Bake in a very hot, well-greased
waffle-iron and serve very hot.</p>


<h4>KENTUCKY WAFFLES</h4>

<p>Make a smooth paste of two cupfuls of sifted
flour and two cupfuls of milk, add one half
cupful of softened butter, not melted, then the
well-beaten yolks of three eggs, then the stiffly
beaten whites, and, just before baking, one
heaping teaspoonful of baking powder. Beat
very hard for five minutes and bake in a hissing-hot
iron.</p>


<h4>MARYLAND WAFFLES</h4>

<p>Beat four eggs separately, the whites to a
stiff froth. To the beaten yolks add a pinch of
salt, two cupfuls of milk, and enough sifted
flour to make a stiff batter. Beat hard until
perfectly smooth and free from lumps. Thin
the batter by adding gradually the beaten
whites of the eggs, and a little more milk in
which a level teaspoonful of baking powder has
been dissolved. Add lastly one tablespoonful
of melted butter or lard. Have the waffle-irons
very hot and well greased, and butter each waffle
as soon as done. Crisp light waffles are delicious
when served with cream and sifted maple-sugar.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span></p>

<h4>PLAIN WAFFLES</h4>

<p>Two cupfuls of sifted flour, two cupfuls of
milk, one tablespoonful of melted butter, one

of melted butter, half a teaspoonful of soda
dissolved in a little of the milk, two eggs well
beaten, and enough flour, sifted in with one
teaspoonful of cream tartar, to make a thin batter.
Beat thoroughly and bake in well-greased
waffle-irons. Cream tartar and spices are practically
certain to be pure when bought of a
druggist instead of a grocer. (Not knocking
the groceryman.)</p>


<h4>RICE AND CORN-MEAL WAFFLES</h4>

<p>One cupful of cold boiled rice, one half cupful
each of wheat flour and corn-meal, one
tablespoonful of melted butter, one half teaspoonful
of soda dissolved in hot water, one
teaspoonful of salt, two eggs, beaten separately,
and enough milk to make a thin batter. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
waffle-irons must be very thoroughly greased
and the baking must be done with great care, as
these waffles are likely to burn.</p>


<h4>SWEDISH WAFFLES</h4>

<p>Two cupfuls of cream, whipped stiff, one half
cupful of sugar, one egg beaten with one fourth
cupful of cold water, one half cupful of melted

<h2>BREAKFAST BEVERAGES</h2>


<p>The breakfast beverage <i>par excellence</i> is coffee,
at least in American households, but, rather
than have coffee poorly made, it is better to
have no coffee at all. The French method of
coffee making has practically superseded the
old-fashioned boiled coffee. Cheap coffee, carefully
made in the proper kind of a pot, has a
better flavor than the more expensive brands
can possibly have when improperly made.</p>

<p>The best coffee-pot on the market, which publishing
ethics forbid us to mention by name, is
made of nickel, comes in five or six different
sizes, has a close fitting cover, a wooden handle,
and has inside a finely woven wire strainer,
which does away entirely with the questionable,
and often unclean, cloth strainer. A
cloth, no matter how carefully kept, will eventually
become saturated with the grounds, and
add the flavor of reheated coffee to the fresh
brew in the pot.</p>

<p>The nickel coffee-pots having the wire
strainer inside are easily kept clean with boiling
water alone, and about once a month may be
boiled out with a weak solution of baking soda.</p>

Various blends of coffee have their champions,
and the blended package coffees are, in
the main, very good. It is better to buy in
small quantities, a pound or two at a time, have
the coffee pulverized very finely at the grocery,
and keep a watchful eye on the man while he
does it, lest he add alien elements to the coffee.
Pulverized coffee keeps perfectly in ordinary
Mason jars, tightly sealed, if bought in small
quantities, as suggested.</p>

<p>The ideal coffee blend is two thirds Mandeheling
Java and one third Arabian Mocha, but
very little genuine Mocha ever reaches this
country, though trusting consumers often pay
high prices for what the man says is sure-enough
Mocha. Pure Java is easier to get, and
South American, Mexican, Cuban, and Porto
Rican coffees are beginning to deserve consideration.</p>

<p>Presuming that we have the pot and a good
quality of coffee, finely pulverized, we will proceed
to brew the nectar of the gods. The water
must be fresh and captured while on its first
boil. Scald the coffee-pot, and put into it one
heaping tablespoonful of pulverized coffee for
each person and another for the poor, neglected
pot. If the coffee is desired extra strong, put in
another tablespoonful, or even two. Pour in one
cupful of boiling water for each tablespoonful
of coffee, keeping the pot over steam, but never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
over the fire itself. Occasionally the grounds
may be lifted from the bottom of the strainer
with a spoon in order to hasten the process a
bit. The strength of Samson may be given the
brew by pouring out a cupful or two of the
coffee after it is made, and compelling it to go
over the ground(s) again.</p>

<p>Put the desired amount of sugar in each cup,
and add a liberal quantity of cream. Fill
three fourths full with coffee and weaken
slightly with freshly boiling water. Coffee
poured into cream and afterward weakened
with boiling water is an entirely different beverage
from that which results when the process is
reversed. Anybody knowing why, please write.</p>

<p>Never, never, never under any circumstances
use the same coffee twice, or add fresh coffee to
the remnant in the pot, if by chance there
should ever be any left. Trim over last year&rsquo;s
hat, if you must, and buy no books for a year except
this one, but do have the daily coffee <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>Our deep feeling on this subject is caused by
our own cherished reputation for coffee making,
which extends as much as three blocks in every
direction of the compass.</p>


<h4>BOILED COFFEE</h4>

<p>One cupful of ground coffee, mixed with a
raw, unbeaten egg, and part of the shell. Add
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
half a cupful of cold water, and put it into the
coffee-pot. Pour over four cupfuls of boiling
water, and as it rises and begins to boil, stir it
with a silver spoon. Let boil hard for ten or
fifteen minutes, then take from the fire. Pour
out one cupful of the coffee, then put it back,
and set the pot on the back of the stove for five
minutes to settle.</p>


<h4>CAF&Eacute; GLAC&Eacute;</h4>

<p>A welcome variant in summer, even for people
who do not like cold coffee. Fill iced-tea
glasses three fourths full of inch cubes of ice,
add a lump or two of sugar, and pour in the
coffee, boiling hot. Do not stir, but add the
cream immediately. For some strange reason,
it is better than if the hot coffee is poured over
the ice, sugar, and cream. Anybody knowing
why, please write.</p>


<h4>CHOCOLATE</h4>

<p>Make exactly like cocoa, using milk instead
of water. A few drops of vanilla added to
chocolate pleasantly accentuates its flavor.</p>


<h4>COCOA</h4>

<p>Directions are given on the package the cocoa
comes in. If not, buy another kind.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span></p>

<h4>TEA</h4>

<p>Cheap tea contains sawdust, dried and powdered
hay, grass-seed, and departed but unlamented
insects. Moral&mdash;buy good tea, or go
without. Have the kettle boiling, and take the
water at the first boil. Scald out the tea-pot,
which must never be of metal, and put into it one
teaspoonful of tea for each person, and one for
the pot, or more, if curly hair for the drinker is
desired. Pour one cupful of boiling water for
each person and another for the pot upon the
tea, and pour off the tea inside of three minutes.
After that the boiling water busies itself in taking
tannic acid out of the tea grounds. Tannic
acid hardens albumen into a leathery substance
of which the most courageous stomach is rightfully
suspicious, and also puckers the mucous
membrane of the stomach into smocking. Persistent
drinking of boiled tea is quite likely to
relieve the stomach altogether of its valued
and hard-worked mucous membrane.</p>

<h2>SIMPLE SALADS</h2>


<p>A salad with mayonnaise dressing is an ideal
<i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> for luncheon. It furnishes
the necessary carbon in a light and easily assimilated
form, and, if well made, is always
palatable.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, there are but two salad
dressings, <a href="#frenchdressing"><b>French</b></a> and <a href="#mayonnaise"><b>mayonnaise</b></a>. The boiled
dressing, with all its variations, is, technically,
a sauce. A true salad dressing is made almost
entirely of oil.</p>

<p>To make French dressing, put into a bowl or
soup plate a pinch of salt, a dash of red pepper,
and three tablespoonfuls of olive-oil. Stir with
a silver spoon until thoroughly mixed, then add
one tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, and stir
until thick. French dressing must not be made
until it is to be used, as it very quickly wilts a
vegetable salad. Four or five tablespoonfuls of
oil may be used to one of vinegar or lemon-juice
if desired, and French dressing may also
be seasoned with tabasco sauce, Worcestershire,
dry mustard, celery salt, or any preferred
condiment.</p>

<p>To make mayonnaise, put into an earthen bowl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
the yolk of a fresh egg and a pinch of salt, a
dash of red pepper and half a teaspoonful of dry
mustard. Place the bowl on ice or in ice water.
Pour one cupful of olive-oil into a small pitcher
from which it will drop easily. When the egg
and seasoning are thoroughly mixed, begin to
add the oil, using a silver teaspoon, and rubbing
rather than stirring. Add the oil until a clear
spot is formed upon the egg, then mix until
smooth. Only a few drops can be added at
first, but the quantity may be gradually
increased. The clear spot upon the egg is
an infallible test of the right quantity of oil. If
too much oil is added, the dressing will curdle.
A few drops of lemon-juice and long beating
will usually make it right again. If this fails,
set the bowl directly on the ice in the refrigerator,
and let stand half an hour. If it is still
curdled, begin again with the yolk of another
egg and add the curdled mayonnaise by degrees
to the new dressing.</p>

<p>When the mayonnaise is so thick that it is
difficult to stir it, add the juice of half a lemon,
or more if desired. If wanted still thinner, add
a little cream at serving-time, but a stiff,
creamy-yellow mayonnaise is a culinary
triumph.</p>

<p>With a little experience, mayonnaise is very
quickly made. It need not take more than
ten or fifteen minutes to make enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
abundantly to serve six people. Packed in
jelly glasses, and covered with wax paper, or
the cover of a jelly glass, mayonnaise will keep
a week or more in a cool place.</p>

<p>A quick mayonnaise can be made by putting
into a bowl half a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of
red pepper, half a teaspoonful of dry mustard,
the yolk of an egg, four tablespoonfuls of olive-oil,
one tablespoonful of lemon-juice or tarragon
vinegar, and beating all together with the egg
beater. If it fails to thicken, it is because the
egg is not strictly fresh, but even if it does not
thicken, it is palatable. A small jar of mayonnaise
dressing, kept upon the ice, is an ever
present help in time of trouble.</p>

<p>All vegetables used for salads must be in
prime condition. Lettuce must be crisp, and
only the perfect leaves used. Ragged edges
may be trimmed off with the scissors. The
head lettuce is best for all salads, but the leaf
lettuce may be used if the other is not obtainable.
It is sometimes shredded into ribbons
with a sharp knife or scissors, but lettuce should
be torn rather than cut, as cutting breaks and
bruises the fibres.</p>

<p>Salads with mayonnaise dressing are too rich
to serve at dinner, and hence are relegated to
luncheons, Sunday-night suppers, and hot-weather
dinners, where no other meat is
served.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
The variety of salads is inexhaustible, and
new combinations are invented every day, many

<h2>LUNCHEON BEVERAGES</h2>


<p>Inasmuch as coffee usually appears both at
breakfast and dinner, it is well to bar it out absolutely
from the luncheon table. Too much
coffee drinking is injurious, as the makers of
imitation coffees assure us daily through the
medium of expensive advertisements. Though
nothing else is quite as good as coffee, yet there
are many other beverages which will prove acceptable
at luncheon.</p>


<h4>MILK</h4>

<p>Serve from an earthen pitcher, either hot or
cold as preferred.</p>


<h4>BUTTERMILK</h4>

<p>Buttermilk is always served ice cold. On a
hot day a glass of buttermilk, and a cracker or
a bit of salted toast will often prove a sufficient
luncheon.</p>


<h4>TEA</h4>

<p>Use the best tea. The cheap tea is dear at
any price. Scald out the tea-pot, which should
never be of metal, and put into it a teaspoonful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
of tea for each person and one for the pot. Add
as many cupfuls of hot water as there are teaspoonfuls
of tea. Cover and let steep for a moment,
but never allow it to boil. The water
for tea must be freshly boiled and taken at the
first vigorous boil. When tea is boiled, tannin
is extracted from the grounds, and tannin, even
in the most minute quantities, has a very injurious
effect upon the lining of the stomach.</p>


<h4>VIENNA CHOCOLATE</h4>

<p>Three heaping tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate
mixed to a paste with cold water. Pour
it into a double boiler with four cupfuls of milk
boiling hot. Add sugar to taste, and let cook
five minutes. Beat the whites of two eggs to a
stiff froth and put into the chocolate pot. Put
a teaspoonful of vanilla into the chocolate after
taking from the fire, and pour the hot chocolate
very slowly upon the eggs, stirring constantly
with a silver spoon or the wooden stick which
comes for the purpose. It makes a delicious,
frothy chocolate. The cocoa which comes in
packages may be used instead of grated chocolate.</p>


<h4>COCOA</h4>

<p>Directions are given on the package the
cocoa comes in. If not, buy another kind next
time.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span></p>

<h4>LEMONADE</h4>

<p>Select perfect lemons and roll until soft.
Extract the juice, using a glass lemon squeezer,
and rejecting the seeds and pulp. Rub cut loaf
sugar over the peel of the lemon to extract the
oil, and add to the lemon-juice. Fill a glass
pitcher one third full of broken ice, pour the
lemon-juice upon the ice, and add granulated
sugar and water to taste.</p>


<h4>ICED TEA</h4>

<p>Make tea according to directions given above,
using two or three extra teaspoonfuls of tea.
Fill a glass pitcher half full of broken ice, and
pour the tea, scalding hot, upon the ice, being
careful that the stream strikes the ice, and not
the pitcher. Serve with cut loaf sugar, and
slices of lemon.</p>


<h4>PINEAPPLE CUP</h4>

<p>Put into a bowl the juice of three lemons,
two oranges, sliced and seeded, one grated
pineapple, and one cupful of sugar. Let stand
an hour to extract the juice, then strain through
a fruit press. Add to the juice as much cold
water as desired, and two slices of pineapple,
shredded. Pour into glasses half full of cracked
ice.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span></p>

<h4>RASPBERRY CUP</h4>

<p>Mash and strain two cupfuls of currants
stripped from the stems. Mash also an equal
quantity of raspberries. Mix the juices, sweeten
to taste, and serve in glasses with cracked ice
and cold water.</p>


<h4>PINEAPPLE LEMONADE</h4>

<p>One cupful of sugar, one cupful of canned
pineapple, one cupful of water and the juice of
two lemons. Boil the sugar and water until it
threads. Put the pineapple through the fruit
press and add to the syrup with the juice of the
lemons. When ready to serve, add water and
sugar to taste. Serve ice cold.</p>


<h4>GRAPE JUICE</h4>

<p>Stem ripe Concord grapes. Do not wash unless
necessary. Cover with cold water and put
into a saucepan over a slow fire. Boil until
the grapes are in pieces, then strain through
coarse cheese-cloth and sweeten to taste. Serve
in glasses with plenty of cracked ice.</p>


<h4><a name="blackberryshrub" id="blackberryshrub"></a>BLACKBERRY SHRUB</h4>

<p>For every cupful of fruit juice take one half
cupful of cider vinegar and two cupfuls of
sugar. Put the fruit, sugar, and vinegar over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
the fire, stir until the sugar dissolves, and boil
until a thick syrup. Skim if necessary, strain,
and bottle. When served, allow one fourth
cupful of syrup to half or three fourths of a
cupful of ice water.</p>


<h4>RASPBERRY SHRUB</h4>

<p>Use ripe red raspberries, and prepare according
to directions given for <a href="#blackberryshrub"><b>Blackberry Shrub</b></a>.</p>


<h4>RASPBERRY DASH</h4>

<p>Fill the tumbler half full of cracked ice.
Add one tablespoonful of sweetened raspberry
juice and one tablespoonful of cream. Fill the
glass with soda water.</p>


<h4>MINT SANGAREE</h4>

<p>Crush two or three sprays of mint with a
lump of sugar. Put into a glass half full of
cracked ice. Add four tablespoonfuls of grape
juice and fill the glass to the brim with charged
water. Shake thoroughly and strain into another
glass.</p>


<h4>SELTZER LEMONADE</h4>

<p>Squeeze the juice of a lemon into a tall glass,
add two inches of shaved ice, two heaping
teaspoonfuls of sugar and fill the glass with
seltzer or Apollinaris.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span></p>

<h4>TEMPERANCE PUNCH</h4>

<p>Upon a tablespoonful of good tea pour two
quarts of boiling water. In the meantime have
ready the juice and peelings of three lemons
and one orange in a pitcher. When the tea has
steeped for five minutes, strain through a fine
strainer into the pitcher. Add a cupful of sugar
and cool slowly. At serving-time put into
glasses with plenty of ice.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span></p>

<h2>EATING AND DINING</h2>


<p>There is an old saying to the effect that &ldquo;all may
eat, but ladies and gentlemen dine.&rdquo; The difference
lies more in the preparation and manner of
serving than in the food itself, and whether her
evening meal is a banquet or a repast of the lunch-counter
sort rests wholly with the housewife.</p>

<p>We pause long enough to pay our disrespects to
that barbarous institution known in America as
the Sunday Dinner. On six days in the week, the
average business man eats a light luncheon or none
at all. On the seventh day, at an unaccustomed
hour, he eats a heavy meal, goes to sleep shortly
afterward, and wonders why Monday is a &ldquo;blue
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our uncivilized Sundays are responsible for our
Monday morning headaches and for the gloom
which, in many a household, does not wear off until
Tuesday morning. If Sunday were a day of fasting
instead of a day of feasting, Monday might be
radiant occasionally instead of riotous or revolutionary.</p>

<p>We make Sunday a hard day for the women of
the household, especially the servants, and the
imperial liver appertaining to the Head of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
Establishment balks sometimes at the strain. The
American Sunday Dinner is one cause of the American
Servant Problem&mdash;and everybody knows what
that is.</p>

<p>In more than one household, a twelve or one
o&rsquo;clock breakfast has proved both hygienic and satisfactory.
Coffee and rolls are served to those who
want them at eight or nine o&rsquo;clock, if they come
into the dining-room. At noon the family sits
down to a simple breakfast&mdash;fruit, broiled chicken,
creamed potatoes, hot bread and coffee, for example.
The maid has few dishes to wash, is not
too tired to enjoy her afternoon off, and gets away
two or three hours earlier than her less fortunate
sisters. Also she remains where she is hired&mdash;which
has its advantages. Only a light lunch is needed
in the evening which the mistress may serve, leaving
the dishes to be washed in the morning.</p>

<p>Owing to the aforesaid American Servant Problem
an increasing number of women do their own housework&mdash;not
from choice, but from stern necessity.
This book is intended for the woman in a small
house or apartment, who is her own cook, who
earnestly desires to do her duty by her family, yet
be something more than a wearied and soul-sickened
drudge; who has to look after her dimes and
nickels, if not her pennies, and who wants more
than the weekly &ldquo;afternoon off&rdquo; accorded to the
stronger women who undertake domestic tasks.</p>

<p>Simplicity&mdash;and, as a general rule, economy&mdash;has
been the standard by which each recipe has
been judged. All are within the capabilities of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
most inexperienced cook, who is willing to follow
directions, and, in the case of such variable materials
as flour and eggs, trust, now and then, to her
own judgment.</p>

cupful of water. Heat thoroughly two cupfuls of
the cooking liquid, one cupful of stock, and three
tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Add two teaspoonfuls
of sugar, two teaspoonfuls of beef extract, and the
dissolved gelatine. If there is not enough liquid to
cover the tongue, add boiling water to make the
necessary quantity. Strain through cheese-cloth.

jelly, and when set, add a layer of the tongue.
Repeat until the mould is full. At serving time
turn out and garnish with parsley.</p>

one teaspoonful of salt with one tablespoonful of
molasses and three tablespoonfuls of sugar, add a
cupful of boiling water, pour over the beans, and
add more boiling water if necessary to fill the pot.
Cover the bean-pot and bake in a slow oven for six
or eight hours, adding boiling water as needed.
During the last hour of cooking, remove the lid so
that the top will be brown. A teaspoonful of
mustard may be added with the other seasoning.
This is the genuine Boston recipe. A sliced onion
put in with the pork is considered by many to be
an improvement.</p>

<p>The recipe for Braised Flank Steak, on page <a href="#Page_318">318</a>, may have some text

<p>There may be a heading missing from the beginning of
page <a href="#Page_516">516</a>, immediately before the recipe for APPLES &Agrave; LA NINON. The

page <a href="#Page_516">516</a> is the start of a collection of 'miscellaneous' dessert

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
